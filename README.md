# Legacy Astrophysics Projects

I was a professional astrophysicist from 2005-ish until 2011. This repo contains my legacy projects. It's impossible to document what is in this repo, so if you're here, best of luck :)

There are (shockingly) two websites that are still live with some context for my work:

* [Entropy work @ MSU](https://web.pa.msu.edu/astro/MC2/accept/)
* [General postdoc work @ OCA and Waterloo](https://www-n.oca.eu/cavagnolo/webpage/Home.html)
