Attention: Marijn Franx\\
Leiden Observatory

To whom it may concern:

Please accept the attached application for the Leiden Astronomy
Fellowship. My current (and proposed) research program focuses on
better understanding feedback from active galactic nuclei, with a
specific emphasis on the connection between the accretion modes of
supermassive black holes, their environments, and the resulting
transport of radiative and mechanical energy back to that environment.
I am also interested in expanding my research into theoretical
modeling, specifically to consolidate our understanding of radio
galaxies and their environments into a unified model which describes
isolated FR-Is through FR-IIs in rich clusters.

My expertise in radio and X-ray astronomy -- in addition to extensive
experience with infrared, optical, and UV data analysis -- ideally
suits me to be a fellow at Leiden Observatory utilizing the existing
and next generation of facilities/instruments, some of which Leiden
Observatory has a vested interest (\ie\ Herschel and LOFAR). Along
with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, a brief summary of
past/current research, and a research proposal. Letters of
recommendation should have already arrived under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
