Dear Prof. Brandt:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position in active galaxy studies advertised in the October 2007 issue
of the AAS Job Register. For my thesis, entitled {\textit{`Feedback,
Evolution, and Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters'}}, I am studying
the coupling of feedback mechanisms -- such as AGN, star formation, and
conduction in cluster cores -- to gas entropy, and the role
of this feedback in altering global ICM properties and truncating the
high mass end of the galaxy luminosity function. I have also been
studying a method for quantifying the virialization state of clusters
through the band dependence of X-ray temperatures. For my thesis I
assembled a sample of 350 archival {\textit{Chandra}} observations for
276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec of data. The results of this laborious
effort have been many and are detailed in my research summary.

My expertise in X-ray astronomy ideally suits me to further work on
better understanding AGN, models for galaxy formation, and feedback in
clusters. Adaptation of my skill sets to study clusters
in the radio, optical, and infrared is the next step in my
career and should come with a short learning curve thanks to my
existing, mature programming ability. I am a great asset for anyone
studying active galaxies and clusters both for my technical skills and
to furthering their research objectives. I feel the post-doctoral
position under your advisory at Penn State is an excellent fit for me,
and your research goals will benefit from my addition.

Along with this letter are my CV, a summary of past and
current research, and a brief description of possible research
directions. Letters of recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit,
and Jack Baldwin will arrive under separate cover. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if there is any further information I can
provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
