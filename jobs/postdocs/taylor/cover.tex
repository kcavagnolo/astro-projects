Attention: Greg B. Taylor, Associate Professor\\
UNM Physics and Astronomy Dept.\\
800 Yale Blvd. NE\\

Albuquerque, NM 87131-0001\\

Dear Prof. Taylor:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral position
advertised through the AAS Job Register. I feel UNM is an excellent
fit for me, and the UNM research environment will benefit from my
addition. My expertise in radio and X-ray astronomy -- in addition to
experience with infrared, optical, and UV analysis -- ideally suits me
to pursue research projects relevant to the LWA key science
projects. I am most interested in the formation and evolution of
SMBHs, and subsequent AGN feedback as it relates to large-scale
structure formation.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, and a
summary of my research interests. Letters of recommendation from Megan
Donahue, Brian McNamara, and Chris Carilli should arrive under
separate cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any
further information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
