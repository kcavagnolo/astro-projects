Dear Prof. Mushotzky:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral position
to work within the High-Energy Extragalactic Astronomy group at the
University of Maryland. I feel the post-doctoral position under your
advisory is an excellent fit for me, and your research goals will
benefit from my addition. My expertise in X-ray and radio astronomy
ideally suits me for the advertised projects, and my familiarity with
infrared, optical, and UV data analysis situates me to be successful
within your research team.

My research program is devoted to developing a better understanding of
galaxy clusters and AGN, and your recent publications suggest we have
very similar scientific interests. I have been especially intrigued by
your work involving Swift/BAT and would like the opportunity to
contribute to that work. Additionally, as you state in the ad, I think
utilization of high S/N and high resolution X-ray data, in conjunction
with the vast wealth of archived UV data, is primed to expand our
knowledge of the connection between AGN, star formation, and their
host X-ray halos. The prospect of working with the UMD staff is very
exciting as my research interests (observational and computational)
overlap with many people currently there: K. Arnaud, T. Bogdanovic,
M. Loewenstein, C. Markwardt, C. Reynolds, to name just a few.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, and a
statement of research interests. Letters of recommendation from Megan
Donahue, Mark Voit, and Brian McNamara should arrive under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
