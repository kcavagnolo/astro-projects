To whom it may concern:

Please find attached my 2011 Einstein Fellowship Program application
titled ``Mapping Galaxy Cluster Magnetic Fields: An Observational
Study of ICM Physics.'' I feel the Einstein post-doctoral program is
an excellent fit for my research goals and that the host institution,
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as well as NASA, will benefit
from my addition. My expertise in X-ray and radio astrophysics, and
mature collaborations with groups in both research areas, has prepared
me for the rigors of the program proposed in this application.

Along with this letter are my curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, a brief summary of my past and on-going research, and a
statement of my proposed research program. Letters of recommendation
from Dr. Megan Donahue, Dr. Mark Voit, and Dr. Brian McNamara, and an
endorsement letter from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, should
arrive under separate cover. In the event a conflict arises with the
proposed host institution, I submit that the University of California,
Berkeley and University of Michigan should serve as the first and
second back-up choices, respectively.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application. Thank you for
your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
