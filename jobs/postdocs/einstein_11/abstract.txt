A detailed description of the diffuse magnetic fields known to
permeate the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, and how they
relate to ICM thermodynamics, remains elusive. With the commissioning
of the EVLA and LOFAR radio observatories, we can now begin making
detailed measurements of cluster magnetic fields (CMFs) for large
cluster samples and start to understand the physics of the ICM. As an
Einstein fellow, I am proposing to use radio polarimetry in
conjunction with X-ray and optical imaging to map CMFs (magnitudes,
orientations, 3D structure) and evaluate their relationship with ICM
thermal properties (e.g. temperature, entropy, pressure) to constrain
which physical mechanisms are responsible for the qualitative
differences between observations and simulations of CMFs. The goals of
this proposal are to determine what processes (e.g. conduction,
turbulence) significantly contribute to heating of the ICM and to
place constraints on the origin of CMFs and their dynamical importance
when making cluster mass estimates.
