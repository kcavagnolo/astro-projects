Dear Dr. Arnaud:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position in X-ray astronomy advertised in the January 2007 issue
of the AAS Job Register. For my thesis (advised by Megan Donahue and
Mark Voit), entitled {\textit{`Feedback, Evolution, and Dynamics in
Galaxy Clusters'}}, I am studying the coupling of feedback mechanisms
-- such as AGN, star formation, and conduction in cluster cores -- to
gas entropy, and the role of this feedback in altering global ICM
properties and truncating the high mass end of the galaxy luminosity
function. I have also been studying a method for quantifying the
virialization state of clusters through the band dependence of X-ray
temperatures. For my thesis I assembled a sample of 350 archival
{\textit{Chandra}} observations for 276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec of
data. The results of this laborious effort have been many and are
detailed in my research summary.

I feel the post-doctoral position under your advisory at
SAp is an excellent fit for me, and your research goals will benefit
from my addition. My expertise in X-ray astronomy ideally suits me to
further study the evolution of galaxy clusters and mass-observable
relations as tools for conducting tests of cosmological models and
toward a better understanding of the cluster mass distribution as a
function of redshift. Adaptation of my skill sets to study clusters in
the radio, optical, and infrared is the next step in my career and
should come with a short learning curve thanks to my existing, mature
programming ability.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, a summary of
past and current research, and a brief description of possible research
directions. Letters of recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit,
and Jack Baldwin should already have arrived under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
