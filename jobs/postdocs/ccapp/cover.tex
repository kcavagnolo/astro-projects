To whom it may concern:

Please accept the attached application for the postdoctoral
fellowship position at The Ohio State University's Center for
Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP). For my thesis, entitled
{\textit{`Virialization, Entropy, and Feedback in Clusters of
Galaxies'}}, I studied the connection of feedback mechanisms --
such as AGN, star formation, and radiative cooling in cluster cores --
to gas entropy, and the role of this feedback in altering global
ICM properties and the impact on galaxy formation. I have also been
studying a method for quantifying the virialization state of clusters
through the band dependence of X-ray temperatures. For my thesis, I
assembled a sample of 350 archival {\textit{Chandra}} observations for
276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec. The results of this laborious task
have been many and are briefly detailed in the research proposal.

Along with this letter are my curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, and my proposed fellowship research program. Letters of
recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit, and Jack Baldwin will
arrive under separate cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if
there is any further information I can provide as you review my
application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
