      from 3D simulations which reproduce observed RMs of embedded and
      background radio sources (taken from Bonafede \etal\ 2010
      [29]). If one assumes the CMF and ICM thermal radial
      distributions trace each, then comparison of observed RM
      dispersions and 3D simulations lead to constraints like this on
      the CMF profile without the need to make measurements at every
      radius. One goal of this proposal is to expand upon the Bonafede
      \etal\ result using a larger cluster sample and EVLA
      observations.}

      Pfrommer \& Dursi 2010 [30] where they argue draping of CMF
      lines at the ICM-infalling galaxy interface explains the CPE
      (left panel at 5 GHz). The CPE results from galactic cosmic rays
      gyrating around regularly compressed field lines. The authors
      argue the Virgo CMF is preferentially radial, consistent with
      the effects of a large-scale MHD convective instability
      [\ie\ the MTI; 21]. Similar measurements are a key feature of
      the EPiCS project and will help us constrain CMF orientations as
      never before.}

      \etal\ 2010 [16] which heats the ICM {\it{only}} via viscous
      dissipation of turbulent ICM motions. The Kunz \etal\ model
      takes in X-ray derived ICM density and temperature measurements
      alone and returns estimates of field strengths. These profiles
      have already been derived for over 300 clusters using the
      \chandra\ archival project, and will be compared with the
      results of the EPiCS program (\eg\ radial profiles and power
      spectra, like Fig. 1) to test how important turbulent heating is
      for an array of cluster types. This is one example of how the
      proposed CMF measurements will be directly compared with model
      predictions to aide theorists in refining models for ICM
      heating.}
