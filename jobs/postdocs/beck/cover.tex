Dear Dr. Beck:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral position
to work within the LOFAR consortium. I feel the post-doctoral position
under your advisory at MPIfR is an excellent fit for me, and your
research goals will benefit from my addition. My expertise in X-ray
and low-frequency radio astronomy ideally suits me for the advertised
work of LOFAR polarization commissioning and conducting original
research using LOFAR.

In September 2008 and June 2009, I attended workshops which focused on
the synergy of galaxy cluster/group and AGN physics. A recurring theme
discussed by observers and theorists at both conferences was the
necessity of establishing a better understanding of diffuse magnetic
fields and radio emission in the ICM and IGM. It was emphasized that
the unique capabilities of LOFAR are necessary to make headway in
these topics. As a result, I became very interested in both subjects
and am excited at the prospect of pursuing a research program in these
areas at MPIfR.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, a brief
summary of past and current research, and a statement of research
interests directly related to LOFAR. Letters of recommendation from
Megan Donahue, Brian McNamara, Chris Carilli, Mike Wise, and Mark Voit
can be obtained via their contact information provided in my
CV. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
