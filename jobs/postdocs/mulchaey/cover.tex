Dear Dr. Mulchaey:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position in X-ray astronomy advertised in the December 2007 issue
of the AAS Job Register. For my thesis (advised by Megan Donahue and
Mark Voit), entitled {\textit{`Feedback,
Evolution, and Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters'}}, I am studying
the coupling of feedback mechanisms -- such as AGN, star formation, and
conduction in cluster cores -- to gas entropy, and the role
of this feedback in altering global ICM properties and truncating the
high mass end of the galaxy luminosity function. I have also been
studying a method for quantifying the virialization state of clusters
through the band dependence of X-ray temperatures. For my thesis I
assembled a sample of 350 archival {\textit{Chandra}} observations for
276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec of data. The results of this laborious
effort have been many and are detailed in my research summary.

I am a great asset for anyone studying active galaxies and clusters
both for my technical skills and to furthering their research
objectives. I feel the post-doctoral position under your advisory at
Carnegie is an excellent fit for me, and your research goals will benefit
from my addition. My expertise in X-ray astronomy ideally suits me to
further work on better understanding AGN, models for galaxy formation,
and feedback in clusters. Adaptation of my skill sets to study
clusters in the radio, optical, and infrared is the next step in my
career and should come with a short learning curve thanks to my
existing, mature programming ability.

Along with this letter are my CV, a summary of past and
current research, and a brief description of possible research
directions. Letters of recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit,
and Jack Baldwin should already have arrived under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
