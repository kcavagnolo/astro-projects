To whom it may concern:

Please accept the attached application for the CRA postdoctoral
fellowship advertised in the AAS Job Register. A key component of my
research program focuses on better understanding feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGN). As such, I have studied, and am deeply
interested in, the accretion modes which fuel supermassive black
holes, the mechanisms which result in relativistic AGN jets, how AGN
jets transport radiative and mechanical energy to an ambient medium,
and how that energy alters an environment. The rich multiwavelength
datasets currently available enable detailed study of SMBHs and AGN in
such a way that existing theoretical models can be tested, and new
discoveries can be made.

I feel the CRA is an excellent fit for me, and the CRA research
environment will benefit from my addition. My expertise in radio and
X-ray astronomy -- in addition to experience with infrared, optical,
and UV analysis -- ideally suits me to further study accreting SMBHs
using the existing and next generation of facilities/instruments (\ie\
NuStar, Simbol-X, SOFIA, ALMA, LOFAR). I am also eager to expand my
research into theoretical modeling, specifically to consolidate our
understanding of radio galaxies and their environments into a unified
model which describes isolated FR-Is through FR-IIs in dense clusters.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, and a brief
statement of my research interests. Letters of recommendation from
Megan Donahue, Brian McNamara, and Mark Voit should arrive under
separate cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any
further information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
