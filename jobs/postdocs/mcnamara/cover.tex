Dear Prof. McNamara:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position in galaxy cluster studies advertised in the September 2007 edition
of the AAS Job Register. For my thesis, entitled {\textit{`Feedback,
Evolution, and Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters'}}, I am studying
the connection of feedback mechanisms -- such as AGN, star formation, and
radiative cooling in cluster cores -- to gas entropy, and the role
of this feedback in altering global properties of the ICM and 
impacting galaxy formation. I have also been studying a method for
quantifying the virialization state of clusters through the band
dependence of X-ray temperatures. For my thesis I assembled a sample
of 350 archival {\textit{Chandra}} observations for 276 clusters. The
results of this laborious task have been many and are detailed in the
research summary.

My expertise in X-ray astronomy, with {\textit{Chandra}}
specifically, ideally suits me to further work on cluster feedback and
galaxy formation models. Adaptation of my skill sets to study clusters
in the radio, optical, and infrared is the next step in my
career and should come with a short learning curve thanks to my
existing, mature programming ability. I am a great asset for anyone
studying clusters both for my technical skills and to furthering
their research objectives. I feel the post-doctoral position under your
advisory at Waterloo is an excellent fit for me, and your research
goals will benefit from my addition.

Along with this letter are my resum\'{e}, a summary of past and
current research, and a brief description of possible research
directions. Letters of recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit,
and Jack Baldwin will arrive under separate cover. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if there is any further information I can
provide as you review my application.

I will be attending the Chandra Symposium in Huntsville, AL October
22$^{nd}$-26$^{th}$ and would like the opportunity to
meet with you and discuss this position further. Thank you for your
consideration.

Sincerely,\\
