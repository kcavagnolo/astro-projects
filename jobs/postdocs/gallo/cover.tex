Attn: Professor Elena Gallo\\
University of Michigan\\
Department of Astronomy

Dear Prof. Gallo:

Please accept the attached application for your advertised
postdoctoral position. A major part of my past and on-going research
has focused on better understanding feedback from active galactic
nuclei (AGN). As such, I am interested in the formation and evolution
of supermassive black holes, the accretion modes which fuel AGN
activity, and how AGN interact with, and alter, their host
environment.

I feel UM is an excellent fit for me, and the UM research environment
will benefit from my addition. My expertise in radio and X-ray
astronomy -- in addition to experience with infrared, optical, and UV
analysis -- ideally suits me for your advertised position. I am also
eager to expand my research into theoretical modeling, specifically to
consolidate our understanding of radio galaxies and their environments
into a unified model which describes isolated FR-Is through FR-IIs in
dense clusters. The UM high-energy astrophysics group is an excellent
place to pursue this goal.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, and a brief
summary of my research interests. Letters of recommendation from Megan
Donahue, Brian McNamara, and Mark Voit should arrive under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
