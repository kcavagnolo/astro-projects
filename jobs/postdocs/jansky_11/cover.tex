To whom it may concern:

Please find attached my 2011 Jansky Fellowship Program application
titled ``Mapping Galaxy Cluster Magnetic Fields: An Observational
Study of ICM Physics.'' I feel the Jansky post-doctoral program is an
excellent fit for my research goals and that the host institution, the
University of Maryland, as well as NRAO, will benefit from my
addition. My expertise in radio and X-ray astrophysics, and mature
collaborations with groups in both research areas, has prepared me for
the rigors of the program proposed in this application.

Along with this letter are my curriculum vitae, a list of
publications, a brief summary of my past and on-going research, a
statement of my proposed research program, and an endorsement letter
from the University of Maryland. Letters of recommendation from
Dr. Megan Donahue, Dr. Mark Voit, and Dr. Brian McNamara should arrive
under separate cover. In the event a conflict arises with the proposed
host institution, I submit that the University of Wisconsin-Madison
and University of Michigan should serve as the first and second
back-up choices, respectively.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application. Thank you for
your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
