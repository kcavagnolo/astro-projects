Dear Dr. Ferrari:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral position
to work within the LOFAR consortium. I feel the post-doctoral position
under your advisory at OCA is an excellent fit for me, and your
research goals will benefit from my addition. My expertise in X-ray
and low-frequency radio astronomy ideally suits me for the advertised
work of studying non-thermal cluster emission with LOFAR.

In September 2008 and June 2009, I attended workshops which focused on
the synergy of galaxy cluster and AGN physics. A recurring theme
discussed by observers and theorists at both conferences was the
necessity of establishing a better understanding of diffuse magnetic
fields and radio emission in the ICM and IGM. As a result, I became
very interested in both subjects and am excited at the prospect of
pursuing a research program in these areas at OCA.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, a brief
summary of past and current research, and a statement of research
interests directly related to LOFAR. Letters of recommendation from
Megan Donahue, Brian McNamara, Chris Carilli, and Mike Wise should
arrive under separate cover. Your requested start date of September
30\ths, 2010 matches well with my existing obligations. Please do not
hesitate to contact me if there is any further information I can
provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
