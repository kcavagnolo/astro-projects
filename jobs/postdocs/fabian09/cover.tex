Dear Prof. Fabian:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral position
to work within the Institute of Astronomy X-ray Group advertised
through the AAS Job Register. A major part of my past and on-going
research has focused on better understanding feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGN). As such, I have studied, and am deeply
interested in, the accretion modes which fuel supermassive black holes
to become AGN, the mechanisms which result in relativistic AGN jets,
how AGN transport radiative and mechanical energy to an ambient
medium, and how that energy alters the environment.

I feel the IoA is an excellent fit for me, and the IoA research
environment will benefit from my addition. My expertise in radio and
X-ray astronomy -- in addition to experience with infrared, optical,
and UV analysis -- ideally suits me to further study accreting SMBHs
using the existing and next generation of facilities/instruments (\ie\
NuStar, Simbol-X, SOFIA, ALMA, LOFAR). I am also eager to expand my
research into theoretical modeling, specifically to consolidate our
understanding of radio galaxies and their environments into a unified
model which describes isolated FR-Is through FR-IIs in dense clusters.

Along with this letter are my CV, a list of publications, and a
summary of my research interests. Letters of recommendation from Megan
Donahue, Brian McNamara, and Mark Voit should arrive under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
