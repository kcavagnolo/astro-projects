Dear Professor Berlind:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position advertised in the November 2007 issue of the AAS Job
Register. For my thesis (advised by Megan Donahue and  Mark Voit),
entitled {\it `Virialization, Entropy, and Feedback in Clusters of
Galaxies'}, I am studying the coupling of feedback mechanisms -- such
as AGN, star formation, and conduction in cluster cores -- to gas
entropy, and the role of this feedback in altering global ICM
properties and truncating the high mass end of the galaxy luminosity
function. I have also been studying a method for quantifying the
virialization state of clusters through the band dependence of X-ray
temperatures. For my thesis I assembled a collection of 350 archival
{\textit{Chandra}} observations for 276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec of
data. The results of this laborious effort have been many and are
detailed in my research summary.

I am a great research asset for any astrophysics group because of my
extensive experience with complex data analysis, innovative technical
skills, and ability to independently advance the group's and my own
research objectives. I feel the post-doctoral position under your
advisory at Vanderbilt is an excellent fit for me and your research
goals will benefit from my addition. My expertise in X-ray
astrophysics ideally suits me to further work in the area of galaxy
cluster evolution and developing better methods for understanding ICM
substructure created by both feedback mechanisms and mergers.

Along with this letter are my resum\'{e} and a summary of past,
current, and future research directions. Letters of recommendation
from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit, and Jack Baldwin will arrive under
separate cover. Please contact me if there is any further information
I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
