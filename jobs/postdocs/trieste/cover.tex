To whom it may concern:

Please accept the attached application for the postdoctoral
fellowship position at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste
(DD97/2007). For my thesis, entitled {\textit{`Feedback,
Evolution, and Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters'}}, I am studying
the connection of feedback mechanisms -- such as AGN, star formation, and
radiative cooling in cluster cores -- to gas entropy, and the role
of this feedback in altering global properties of the ICM and 
impacting galaxy formation. I have also been studying a method for
quantifying the virialization state of clusters through the band
dependence of X-ray temperatures. For my thesis I assembled a sample
of 350 archival {\textit{Chandra}} observations for 276 clusters. The
results of this laborious task have been many and are briefly detailed
in the research proposal.

Along with this letter are the required application forms, copy of my
passport, my curriculum vitae with list of publications, and my
proposed fellowship rsearch program. Letters of recommendation from
Megan Donahue, Mark Voit, and Jack Baldwin will arrive under separate
cover. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further
information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
