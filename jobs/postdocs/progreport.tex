\textbf{RE: Progress Report on Dissertation Completion Fellowship}
\normalsize

Dear Dr. Klomparens:

On July 31\st, 2008 I successfully defended my dissertation entitled
{\it{``Investigating Feedback and Relaxation in Clusters of Galaxies
    with the Chandra X-ray Observatory''}} which was completed under
the guidance of Dr. Megan Donahue (Department of Physics and
Astronomy). On August 5\ths, 2008 the MSU Graduate School officially
accepted my formatted dissertation. On August 11\ths, 2008 I was
notified by mail that Michigan State University had officially granted
me the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Astronomy \&
Astrophysics. Beginning September 1\st, 2008 I will be a postdoctoral
fellow under the advisory of Dr. Brian McNamara at the University of
Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

During my semester of support, all of the goals set forth in my
accepted application were met, with all but one of them occurring on
schedule. The proposed defense date of May 2008 had to be extended to
September 2008 so that the full scope of my research would be included
in the thesis. Extending the defense date into summer allowed for all
three of the main thesis chapters, not just two, to be accepted for
publication in the peer reviewed Astrophysical Journal, Astrophysical
Journal Supplement Series, and Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The CNS Dissertation Completion Fellowship (DCF) was instrumental in
allowing me the time necessary to complete my thesis. The DCF funds
will be tangibly seen in the diploma which will hang on my office
wall. All of the DCF funds were used to cover my university expenses
and supplement my monthly stipend up to the day of defense. I am
forever grateful to the CNS for awarding me the DCF, and proudly
include the award on my curriculum vitae. I have already encouraged
all of the other graduate students in the Astronomy \& Astrophysics
program to apply for the fellowship when the time comes as it is a
wise use of time and resources to do so.

Sincerely,\\
