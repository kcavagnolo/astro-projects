Dear Professor Buote:

Please accept the attached application for your postdoctoral
position advertised in the December 2007 issue of the AAS Job
Register. For my thesis (advised by Megan Donahue and Mark Voit),
entitled {\it `Virialization, Entropy, and Feedback in Clusters of
Galaxies'}, I am studying the coupling of feedback mechanisms -- such
as AGN, star formation, and conduction in cluster cores -- to gas
entropy, and the role of this feedback in altering global ICM
properties and growth of massive galaxies. I have also studied a
method for quantifying the virialization state of clusters. For my
thesis, I assembled a sample of 350 archival \Chandra\ observations
for 276 clusters totaling 11.6 Msec of data. The results of this
laborious effort have been many and are detailed in my research
summary.

I am a valuable research asset for any X-ray astronomer because of my
extensive experience with X-ray data, innovative technical skills, and
ability to independently advance the group's and my own research
objectives. I feel the post-doctoral position under your advisory at
U.C. Irvine is an ideal fit for me, and your research goals will benefit
from my addition. I have acquired considerable expertise with galaxy
clusters and groups, and along with my own research interests, I am
eager to pursue new projects in this field.

Along with this letter are my \cv, a list of publications, a summary of
my research experience, and a description of research interests. Letters of
recommendation from Megan Donahue, Mark Voit, and Jack Baldwin should
already have arrived under separate cover. Please contact me if there
is any further information I can provide as you review my application.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,\\
