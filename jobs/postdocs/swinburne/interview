"So, tell us about your work?"
- the adiabatic model of hierarchical structure formation results in clusters which are self-similar (meaning the are scaled versions of each other)
- self similarity is important because it provides a means for calculating mass directly from observables like temperature and luminosity
- and clusters are an important probe for cosmological studies because they provide complementary, and orthogonal, constraints to other geometric measures like CMB fluctuations, BAO, and SNe
- but observations show clusters are not scaled versions of each other and that at even smaller scales (like groups and ellipticals) the case is even worse
- this breaking of self-similarity results in broad dispersion in mean mass-scaling relations, which if not corrected for, will result in the over and under prediction of cluster masses
- this is bad news for the holy grail of high-precision cluster cosmology: mass selected samples from SZ surveys
- so this is where my work comes in...
- breaking of self similarity results from non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, merger shocks, or the shape of the cluster potential
- I've studied two of these areas: mergers and cooling

mergers:
- during a merger, shock heating or cool, spectroscopically unresolved, accreting subclusters can result in band specific bias of integrated cluster temperature
- ME01 found this effect in analysis of simulations which negelected radiative cooling
- they suggested a study using Chandra could detect this biasing
- so we undertook the study...
	+ cda limited sample
	+ measure soft and hard band temps
	+ calc ratio
	+ account for systematics (s/n, redshift effects, column dens, cross-calib w/ XMM)
	+ high Thfr corre. w/ non-cool cores
	+ high Thfr corre. w/ known mergers
	+ follow-up by Vent and Voit

cooling:
- the inner regions of the ICM in some clusters has a cooling time shorter than a Hubble time
- this prodigious cooling results in higher lum and lower temp at a given mass, thus creating intrinsic scatter in SS relations
- so to understand this scatter we must study the effects of cooling and any feedback which may result
- observations show that the gas does not cool completely (not to less than 1/3 the virial temp anyway), something retards cooling in the core
- heating of the icm by agn blown bubbles is the favored model at the moment
- one way to understand agn heating and feedback in general is by studying the entropy distribution of the ICM
- entropy as I define it is a fundamental property of the ICM, moreso than temp and dens alone
	+ temp reflects the depth of the grav pot wel: heating and cooling results in expansion and contraction of the gas within the well
	+ dens reflects the wells capacity to compress that heated/cooled gas
	+ specific entropy on the other hand determines the density at a given pressure, and reflects the change in enthalpy at a given temp
	+ so X-ray observables are actually a manifestation of the DM haloes depth and shape, in addition to the ICM entropy
- so by studying entropy, one is studying the entire thermal history of the cluster
- my entropy work:
	+ cda limited sample
	+ measure tx(r)
	+ measure sb(r)
	+ derive ne(r)
	+ calc K(r)
	+ strong relation between low-entropy (short cooling time) gas and evidence of feedback
	+ univ. ent pedestal
	+ bimodal K0
	+ K0 < 20 means star formation and radio-loud AGN
	+ K0 = 20 is conductive stable limit
		++ Field length: through a scaling conincidence, Field length is a function of entropy alone, lambda=K^(3/2)*sqrt(suppression)
		++ Tantilizing result to solve self-regulation and distribution of energy problems
	+ Timescale of AGN feedback set at few Myrs
	+ entropy scaling relations
	+ evolution of cool cores
- a classification system based simply around the central entropy value would be the most comprehensive way of understanding a clusters dynamic state

"What are your plans for future work?"
- for my independent research plan...
- solve bimodality w/ cycle 10 prop
- Spitzer-XMM archival project of SF in BCGs
- observational tests of ICM heating with bubbles
- understand low entropy systems w/o SF or AGN
- understand high entropy systems w/ AGN
- developing model for feedback regulation via conduction
- get into radio, ir, and optical analysis
- hopefully construct a strong resume and program to pursue prize fellowships (hubble, chandra, carnegie)
- very longterm I want to get a faculty position somewhere

"What do you want to accomplish as a post-doc?"
- resolve questions raised by my thesis
- illuminate the connection between feedback and conduction
- accomplish group specific goals

"What are the shortcomings of your work?"
- isolated, meaning no large collaboration or greater context
- lack of modeling to now: conduction

"Why do we need more sophisticated models of mergers?"
- simulations currently do not properly reproduce the entropy structure of real clusters
- entropy greater than 100 is difficult, if not impossible, to generate with AGN alone
- pre-heating is definitely part of the energy budget
- but soft mergers which create cold fronts may be important too...
- but sims currently lack the resolution to properly get feedback working or make cold fronts in a cosmo volume

Cold fronts:
- what are they?
	+ increase in dens and sb
	+ decrease in temp
	+ inverted behavior from shock fronts
- in a merger, the gas entropy can increase beyond the ambient entropy via shock heating
	+ this leads to convective instability
	+ this leads to hot underdense gas bubbles
	+ which lead to buoyant gas rising along grav. gradient (ie perp to merger axis)
- merge-o-meter for clusters
- different types:
	+ sling-shot
	+ ?
	+ ?
- uses:
	+ the width of the front is several times smaller than the Coulomb mean free path for electrons; this indicates that the thermal conduction must be suppressed, at least across the front
