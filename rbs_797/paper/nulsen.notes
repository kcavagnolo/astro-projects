Hi Ken,

Yet again, sorry for being so slow.  There are only a few significant 
corrections here, but I think you could improve the presentation.  Brian 
and I may still differ over a couple of issues, so I will CC to give him 
a chance to respond.  I guess I do agree with Brian that the discussion 
of spin gets a bit more space than it probably deserves.  By contrast, 
if anything, the HST imaging is underplayed.

Regards
Paul

Abstract: Rather than "Based on the presence of bright rims enclosing
the cavities, we speculate weak shocking...," how about "Based on
their similar appearance to MS0735.6+7421, we suggest that the
prominent cavities in RBS 797 are driving shocks (M ~ 1.5) into the
ICM" ("speculating" in an abstract is not a good idea in any case).

Introduction, par 2: B04 made little effort at interpretation, so
"...suggests the system may be more complex than B04 could constrain"
would be more accurate as "...suggests the system may be more complex
than B04 assumed."

2.1: "Events file" is an error due to non-English speakers.  Please do
not propagate it.  It is called an "event file" (eg in the CIAO web
pages; or compare grocery store, car park, coat rack...).

3.1: "Skewed" is generally used in the technical sense to mean bent in
one direction (so that the mode and mean differ, for example).  Do you
mean to say more than "Outside of $\simeq 50$ kpc, the global ICM
morphology is regular and elongated along the northwest-southeast
direction?"  If so, I am missing the point.

Par 3: There is a long history of spurious structure found in optical
images by subtracting models.  I'm not sure what bmodel does, but it
sounds complex (PA and ellipticity varying), so it might be a good
idea to show an image of the model.

Par 4: opposing -> opposite (not the same)

At the risk of opening another can of worms, to me, it looks as though
there could be a very small set of cavities running roughly
north-south at the centre of the BCG in the raw image.  In the zoomed
image, this feature is just a few low pixels immediately to the north
and south of the AGN and it looks pretty unimpressive.  However, (as
far as I can tell from looking at your radio images) the structure I
see would fit nicely around the 4.8 GHz radio emission, with the rims
(asymmetric) being the S shaped structure you already mention.  This
is worth a sentence or two at best, but I would mention it.  Eg,
"There is a hint of barely resolved structure in the Chandra image
associated with the 4.8 GHz radio image in Fig. 2, with X-ray deficits
around the tips of the radio jets, bounded to one side by the 'S'
shaped feature noted above.  This is suggestive of small cavities with
asymmetric bright rims created by the 4.8 GHz radio jets."  At the
least, you could point out that the S shaped structure borders the 4.8
GHz jets (if this is correct!).

3.3.1, par 1: "...same regions..." -> "...congruent regions..."

Do you really mean "A systematic error of 10% is assigned to the
cavity volumes?"  It looks as though the 10% error applies to the
cavity dimensions.  The systematic error in the volume is huge, as
dicussed in the paper.

Par 2: The quantity $\gamma PV / (\gamma - 1)$ is the enthalpy of a
cavity, not its energy.  "The energy required to create a cavity is
estimated by its enthalpy, E_{cav} = ..., which was calculated
assuming..."

Par 3 (and 1): Referring to the "spherical" assumption is confusing.
The way that Birzan et al came at this volume estimate was to argue
that when we only know the two semi-axes on the sky, a and b, the two
reasonable extreme estimates for the volume are obtained by assuming
that the cavity is either a prolate (minimum volume $= 4\pi/3 a b^2$)
or an oblate (maximum volume $= 4 \pi/3 a^2 b$) ellipsoid.  Taking the
geometric mean of these two volumes as representative amounts to using
r_los = \sqrt{a b}.  Spheres do not come into this (any volume can be
related to an equivalent sphere, but who cares).  Rather than the
"spherical" assumption, maybe you could call this the "representative"
assumption.  If you change the term, it needs to fixed in a few
places.

Too many significant digits are given for the key parameters.

3.3.2, par 1: Suggest "Note the potential for confusion..." -> "Note
that $y$ is 1 if there is no decrement, while small values of $y$
correspond to large decrements."

The difference between the decrement model of Wise et al and 3.3.3 is
the rims.  It would be a good idea to stress this with a comment near
here.  At the end of par 1 (or maybe a new par 2): "Note that the
decrement model of Wise et al. (2007) used here assumes that a cavity
simply replaces some X-ray emitting gas with non-emitting material,
without disurbing the surrounding gas.  To be valid, the model
requires that there is little uplifted gas surrounding a cavity
(cf. Nulsen et al. 2005b" - Hydra A or some other system with
significant uplift in the rims - ") and that the cavity is not driving
significant shocks into its surroundings (cf. section 3.3.3)."

Par 2: Avoid double negatives: "Integration revealed..." -> "For this
case, the most significant decrement obtained was $y = 0.67$,
indicating that $r_{los}$ is required to exceed $r_{eff}$."

Also "If the cavities are moving..." -> "If the cavities are moving
away from the AGN in the plane of the sky, then it is surprising to
find that each has its shortest axis in the plane of the sky, almost
perpendicular to its direction of motion, while also having its
longest axis along our line of sight, also perpendicular to its
motion."  The last sentence could also be clarified (or deleted).

3.3.3: The discussions of rims and their significance for energetics
have been mixed together.  It would be clearer if they were untangled.
I would begin with the rims, then deal with their implications.  "The
Chandra X-ray image of RBS 797 bears a strong resemblance to that of
MS0735.6+7421, with a bright elliptical region at its center enclosing
two prominent cavities.  In MS0735.6+7421, the bright central region
is bounded by Mach $\simeq 1.4$ shocks.  Although there is no evidence
for density or temperature jumps in the Chandra data for RBS 797, the
spatial resolution in RBS 797 is a lot poorer than for MS0735.6+7421
(the angular scale of shocks in RBS 797 would be $\sim 10\times$
smaller).  Based on their similar appearances, we suggest that the
prominent central ellipse in the X-ray image of RBS 797 may also be
surrounded by moderately strong shocks.  The lack of evidence for
shocks may simply be a consequence of the poor spatial resolution."

Note to Brian: Would the XMM image of MS0735 alone have convinced you
it has shocks?  This gets the relative scales (though not the
exposures) about right.

Continuing: "A simple " - simplistic is usually perjorative - "model
that captures..., but it demonstrates how bright rims created by
shocks may enhance the cavity decrement in RBS 797...as the
compression increases.  Thus the analogy with MS0735.6+7421 is also
consistent with the relatively large cavity decrements found in RBS
797."

Then follow with any comments on the significance of shocks.  You
should be aware that impact of shocks on power estimates is subtle
(and generally modest).  In the cases where they have been compared,
the shock energy is mostly comparable to the cavity energy (they are
really two estimates of the same thing).  The most extreme instance I
know of is the SW lobe of Cen A, which is overpressured relative to
the gas at its remote tip by ~2 orders of magnitude.  However,
estimates of its pressure based on the inner thermal shock give us a
good estimate of the lobe pressure, and computing the enthalpy based
on that pressure gives a decent estimate of the total energy dumped
into the lobe.

3.4: The range of efficiency factors you quote (0.06 - 0.4) are
obtained by computing the total energy dissipated in a thin disk that
terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit.  These values are
reasonable estimates for the efficiency of radiative losses from a
thin disk, but questionable if the disk is thick (RIAF) and even more
suspect as efficiency estimates for jets.  If you feel that you need
to give numbers, you should be careful to state what they are.  It is
an error to imply that epsilon is known (compare the range of jet
efficiency in Fig. 1 of Nemmen et al; see comments on 3.4.3 below).

M_{acc} should be in units of Msun (not Msun yr^{-1}).

3.4.1:  To avoid giving the impression that their masses are
comparable, "Optical nebulae and substantial quantities of cold
molecular gas..."

The next sentence is a non sequitur.  Maybe you meant "This gas may be
the end point of thermally unstable cooling in the hot atmosphere.
Potentially, it is a significant source of fuel for AGN activity and
star formation (refs)."

"Under these assumptions..." is cumbersome.

Par 2: This argument is weak.  The observations require that the bulge
and BH are coupled stochastically, not tightly.  Unless M_BH increases
by a substantial factor, there is no need for the stars to form in
synch.  This issue was discussed in Rafferty et al., with the
conclusion that BH and bulge growth do not occur in lock step (at
least for the radio mode), even though the correlation is preserved.

3.4.2, par 2: I do not understand the statement "The large value of
\dot m_B is troubling..."  For Bondi accretion, the flow speed at the
Bondi radius is comparable to the sound speed (about one tenth for
gamma = 5/3 to be more accurate).  If the accretion rate is to exceed
the Bondi rate by a substantial margin, gas must flow in through the
Bondi radius hypersonically.  This is physically unreasonable, so I
cannot make sense of your comment.

It is a little confusing that you use different temperatures (0.5 and
1 keV) when discussing the observability of the gas.

3.4.3, par 3: From the discussion in 3.4.2, if the jet efficiency is
0.1 we need $\dot m_E \simeq 0.02$.  This result is independent of the
hybrid model, apart from the fact that a high spin is required to
reach this jet efficiency.  It would be better to say something like
"In the hybrid spin model of Nemmen et al (2007), the jet efficiency
($\epsilon$ above) is strongly dependent on black hole spin.  For
example, for a disk viscosity parameter of $\alpha = 0.25$, " - no
need to cite Quataert & Narayan - "we require a black spin parameter
$j > 0.96$ to obtain $\epsilon > 0.1$.  The required spin depends on
the viscosity parameter, but not sensitively (e.g., $\alpha = 0.04$,
would require $j > 0.92" - CHECK - ").  In general, a high jet
efficiency demands a high spin parameter.  Alternatively, for a spin
parameter of 0.6? " - CHECK - " the jet efficiency would be 0.01,
boosting the mass required to fuel the outburst by an order of
magnitude and exacerbating the issues of accounting for the fuel
discussed above."  My numbers are guessed from Fig. 1 of Nemmen+, so
they are not reliable.

The next bit baffles me.  Increasing the black hole mass does not
alter the accretion efficiency (for the Nemmen+ model), so it does
nothing to alter the amount of mass that must be accreted.  If the
efficiency is unchanged, greater M_BH does reduce the accretion rate
in Eddington units, but not the absolute accretion rate.  I think you
have forgotten to modify the Eddington accretion rate on one side of
this equation.  This bit should probably be removed.

The bit on Garofalo is fine, but the key is that he argues for greater
jet efficiency with a counter rotating hole.

Orbits are retrograde (not spin): "..extremely powerful jets are
produced when the disk is retrograde relative to the spin of the
SMBH."

3.5: "There is a bright X-ray point source apparent in the CXO
imaging " - Chandra image? - "that coincides with the nucleus of the
BCG,..."

Par 3: "...roughly $\lessim..." is redundant

3.6, par 5: This stuff is very interesting, but the optical emission
does not necessarily arise from interaction.  Can you rule out optical
synchrotron or inverse Compton (possibly Doppler boosted) from the
jet?

People may read "BCG halo" to mean the stellar halo, whereas I presume
you mean the gas.

"bares" -> "bears"

Conclusions, item 2: This relies on the assumptions of the Wise et al
decrement model, which we have argued against in section 3.3.3.  It
would be more accurate to say that either the depths of the cavities
are considerably greater than their projected sizes, or the simple
decrement model is incorrect.  In the latter case, the contrast of the
cavities may be enhanced significantly by compressed, shocked gas.

Item 4: As noted in my comments for 3.4.3, I think the number in the
last sentence is incorrect.

Item 5: This needs work.
