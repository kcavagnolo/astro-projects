F-test
======

This is a simple program to compare two fits to the same set of data
using the F-Test. Given two fits with determine values of chi-squared
per degree of freedom, the program outputs the probabilities that each
fit is better than the other.

Requirements
============

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is required for this program to
compile.  If you do not have it installed already, the GSL can be
obtained from the Free Software Foundation at
"http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNUsl.html".

Installation
============

1. Edit the Makefile so LIB_AND_INC_DIR points to the directory that
   contains your include and lib directories.  The GSL include files
   should be in $LIB_AND_INC_DIR/include/gsl while the libraries should
   be in $LIB_AND_INC_DIR/lib/.  If your system has a different
   directory structure, you should change the CINCS and CLIBS variables
   directly.

2. Run "make"

3. Run "make install".  To install into a directory other than
   /usr/local/bin, change the INSTALL_DIR in the Makefile.
