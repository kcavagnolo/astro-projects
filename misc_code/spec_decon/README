Description:
  Fits concentric annular spectra in Sherpa. The algorithm for
  determining the contributions of the outer annuli to the spectra of
  the inner ones was adapted from the program norm_ang by Liz Blanton,
  with modifications for the case of elliptical (instead of circular)
  annuli. Uses the same FITS header keywords used by the projct model
  in XSPEC, so the same files can be used for both purposes without
  the need for additional files to describe the onion skin geometry.
  Output is a text file containing the results of the fits and a
  postscript file with a plot of those results.
