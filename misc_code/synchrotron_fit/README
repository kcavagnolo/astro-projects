synchrotron_fit:

This program fits three synchrotron models to the supplied datafile.
The models used are:

Kardashev and Pacholczyk (KP) model:
	Kardashev, N. S., 1962, Soviet Astron.-AJ, 6, 317
	Pacholczyk, A. G. 1970, Radio Astrophysics (San Francisco: Freeman)
Jaffe and Perola (JP) model:
	Jaffe, W. J., & Perola, G. C. 1973, A&A, 26, 423
Continuous Injection (CI) model: 
	Heavens,A.F., & Meisenheimer, K.  1987, MNRAS, 225, 335

The exact forms of these models are listed in the comments of the file
`synchrotron_functions.c`.  


The author wishes to thank Chris Carilli for making his synchrotron
fitting code available while I was working on this.  It helped greatly
in helping me understand how these models are calculated.

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is needed to compile this program.
It can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.  No other
external libraries are used, and it should compile on any platform
with a c compiler, although it has only been tested using GCC on
Linux.

Please include a citation to the paper "Ultraviolet Hubble Space
Telescope Observations of the Jet in M87" (Waters, C. Z., & Zepf,
S. E. 2005, ApJ, 624, 656) in any works that use this code.
