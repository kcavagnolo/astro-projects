***
The main criterion for proposal selection is the contribution of the
proposed program of research to the scientific return of the Physics
of the Cosmos missions.
***

Prop should:
	o Demonstrate relation to NASA Physics of the Cosmos (PoC) program:
	  Chandra, Fermi, XMM, INTEGRAL, IXO, Planck, JDEM, and LISA
	o New, archival, and theoretical studies welcome
	o Multiwavelength data for sources studied with these missions

The Big Questions from PoC web site:
	o What are the origin, evolution and fate of the Universe?
        o How do planets, stars, galaxies and cosmic structure come into being?
        o When and how did the elements of life in the Universe arise?

- Is there a fundamental difference in the entropy profiles which
arise from convection heating versus conduction heating?

- Is it possible that we could learn about the AGN feedback loop and
the primary heating mechanism through something as simple as the
1D entropy profiles?

- AGN Feedback:
	+ How are they fueled? Spin? Accretion? Both? Where's the break point?
		~ Spin: how can we prove this observationally?
		~ Accretiong: how do we narrow 

- There is a fundamentally missing problem with understanding the agn feedback loop and the heating of the ICM: we do not have good observational constraints on the magnetic field strength in clusters, jets, bubbles, etc. Let's measure this! FR measures of the ICM would be great.
