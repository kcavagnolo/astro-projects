We propose to observe the peculiar cluster Abell 1983 (no current
Chandra observation) to conduct a detailed study of a cluster which
has characteristics of both the cool core (CC) and non-cool core (NCC)
cluster populations. From the existing XMM-Newton observation the
cluster looks like a NCC system with a core cooling time $>$ 3 Gyr and
a gas energy content which suggests past energy injection of $>
10^{61} \erg$. Yet A1983 also looks like a CC system with
$T_{core}/T_{cluster} < 1$, a peaked central metal abundance, and a
BCG which is likely forming stars. A study of this rare cluster will
aide in developing a better understanding of not just A1983's
dynamical state, but of what may be a stage in cluster evolution which
is vital to understanding the cool core/non-cool core dichotomy.
