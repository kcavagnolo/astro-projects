%% LaTeX template for the science justification & technical
%% feasibility to be submitted as part of a Chandra X-ray Observatory
%% proposal.
%%
%% Chandra cycle 9


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% DOCUMENT FORMAT %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The default font was chosen to be easily readable while allowing
%% sufficient material to be included.

%% The two-column, 11pt format fits the largest number of characters
%% per page while still being within allowed limits.

%% There are three documentclass commands provided below. Please
%% uncomment the version you would like to use and comment out the
%% others.

%% Please note that the proposal will be printed on US Letter size paper,
%% 8.5 in x 11 in, and that formatting the text for other sizes will
%% generally cause layout problems and may result in text being cut
%% off near the edges. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE 'LETTERPAPER' OPTION
%% IN THE DOCUMENTCLASS COMMAND.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Converting this document to PDF %%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% We suggest the following method for this template because most
%% proposal reviewers will 
%% be reading your Scientific Justification on a computer screen, and
%% many reviewers only have PDF (not PostScript) viewing capability. By
%% default, a document produced with LaTeX uses so-called cm fonts, which
%% differ significantly from any of the standard Type1 fonts built-in to
%% PDF. PDF uses low-resolution bitmap images of these fonts to display
%% the document. It prints well, but shows degraded resolution on the
%% screen. 

%% Use ps2pdf (preferably version 1.4) to convert a postscript file to PDF:
%% 
%% latex file.tex
%% dvips -Ppdf -G0 -o file.ps file.dvi
%% ps2pdf14 file.ps file.pdf 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Displaying DS9 figures %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% If you experience pdf errors when displaying figures you produced with DS9:

%% Solution: Remake figure in DS9 and save as Postscript Level 1. In
%% the Print window choose Level 1 under the Postscript heading. At this
%% point you should re-LaTeX your SJ following the directions above.

%%%%% HOW TO INCLUDE FIGURES %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Please see the ``Included packages'' section below.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Included packages %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{graphics,graphicx}

%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your
%% favorite packages. 

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.  

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%% 
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).
