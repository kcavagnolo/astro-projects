Objects:
A2111
A2218
A2219
A2261

Wants:

1) X-ray centroids [for comparison with the BCG position, with the
centroid of the cluster member galaxy distribution, and with the
centroid of the WL mass map]

2) X-ray surface brightness distribution [for comparison with the 2d
WL mass map - e.g. for comparison of multipole moments]

3) Mass profiles derived from the temperature maps, except for A2111
where that is not possible
