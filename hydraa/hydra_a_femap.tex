The abundance map shown in Figure \ref{fig:femap} was created using
the contour binning code discussed in \citet{2006MNRAS.371..829S}. The
three ACIS-S flare-clean, point source excluded images were filtered
in the energy range 0.3-8.0 keV, combined, and finally normalized by
the corresponding exposure map. The resulting image was smoothed on a
SN scale of 10, and the final map bins were generated by following the
smoothed surface brightness contours and accreting to a SN per bin of
150. The large SN value was selected to balance the uncertainties on
the best-fit abundances while preserving the excellent spatial
resolution afforded by the large number of source counts. For each map
bin and each observation, a spectrum and response was extracted. The
individual spectra for each bin were then fitted simultaneously in the
energy range 0.7-7.0 keV using Xspec \citep{xspec} with an absorbed
single component {\textsc{MeKaL}} model \citep{mekal1, mekal2, mekal3}
with fixed $N_H$ from the LAB survey \citep{lab} and \citet{ag89}
solar abundance values. The uncertainties were calculated on the 90\%
confidence interval and $\chi^2$ was the fit statistic.
