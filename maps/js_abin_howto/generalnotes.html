<h1>General notes</h1>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
The code is implemented using C++. It compiles using recent egcs and
gcc compilers (tested using egcs-2.91.66, gcc-2.95, and RedHat
gcc-2.96 snapshot). Other C++ compilers probably won't work
(unfortunately the C++ standard isn't implemented by most compilers,
even gcc), but patches to make the code compatible are welcome.
</p>
<p>
The code has been found to compile on RedHat Linux 6.1 and 7, Compaq
Tru64 (V4.0F) and Solaris. I don't have access to any other platforms.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
The code requires the <a
href="http://asca.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/">CFITSIO</a>
library to read and write FITS format files. If the library is not in
your standard include and library paths, then you'll need to add it by
hand before compiling the programs. If you've got <a
href="http://asca.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/ftools_menu.html">FTOOLS</a>
installed and set-up, then the following commands should work (in
tcsh):
</p>
<pre>
setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH ${FTOOLS}/include
setenv LIBRARY_PATH ${FTOOLS}/lib
</pre>
<p>
In general, you will need add the CFITSIO include and library paths to
these two environment variables.
</p>

<p>
A copy of GNU make is also required.
