<h1>Adbin build instructions</h1>

<p>
Ideally I should use a tool such as GNU automake to create the make
files for the program, but as the code is only for compilation with
GNU gcc, I use a simple makefile. The code is intended for use on Unix
systems. People with other operating systems are on their own!
</p>

<p>
I've made binaries of the latest distribution. If you would prefer to
not build your own copy, download them from <a
href="download/binaries/">here</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the Adbin tar.gz distribution</li>
<li>Extract the distribution. With GNU tar the command line is:
<pre>
# tar xzf AdaptiveBin-x.x.tar.gz
</pre>
With other tars you may need something similar to the command line:
<pre>
# gunzip AdaptiveBin-x.x.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre>
</li>
<li>Change to the distribution directory, i.e.
<pre>
# cd AdaptiveBin-x.x
</pre>
</li>
<li>If necessary, add the CFITSIO include and library directories to
the gcc search paths. See <a href="generalnotes.html">general
notes</a> for help on how to do this.
</li>
<li>
Use GNU make to build the executables. If GNU make is the standard
make on your system, then type:
<pre>
# make all
</pre>
Other systems may use <code>gnu-make</code> or <code>gmake</code> as
their GNU make.
</li>
<li>
If there are no errors, then you can copy the executables somewhere
handy. For example:
<pre>
# mkdir ~/adbin
# cp AdaptiveBin ABPixelCopy FITSMaths ~/adbin
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>I've found one problem linking the executables on some solaris
machines. I've manually had to add <code>-lnsl -lsocket</code> to the
linking command, as they are not linked by default.</li>
</ol>
