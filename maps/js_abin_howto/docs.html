<h1>Adbin documentation</h1>

<p>Some documentation for using the programs is presented here. In
general, the programs try to mainain RCS information from the input
files to the output files. If this documentation is insufficient,
please examine the source code for the programs or email me.</p>

<p>I have some other related utilities, which are not ready for public
release. Contact <a href="mailto:jss@ast.cam.ac.uk">me</a> if you wish
to be informed of updates.</p>

<h2>Programs</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="adbin.html">AdaptiveBin</a> - main adaptive binning
program</li>
<li><a href="abpixelcopy.html">ABPixelCopy</a> - apply an existing
pixel file to an image</li>
<li><a href="FITSMaths.html">FITSMaths</a> - useful FITS manipulation
tool</li>
</ul>

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>Here are some useful definitions to know when reading the
documentation.</p>

<table border="1">

<tr><td><dfn>Pixel</dfn></td>
<td>The individual picture-elements which make up the input
image.</td></tr>

<tr><td><dfn>Bin</dfn></td>
<td>A collection, or list, of pixels.</td></tr>

<tr><td><dfn>Error map</dfn></td>
<td>An image of the same size as the input image(s). Each pixel in
the error map contains the fractional-error of the value in the pixel
in the output map. The value in a pixel is the value of the bin
containing the pixel.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><dfn>Bin map (name changed from pixel map)</dfn></td>
<td>An image of the same size as the input image(s). Each bin created
by the adaptive-binning program is labelled by an integer, starting
with 0. The value of a pixel in the bin map specifies which bin the
pixel belongs to. Using the bin map, other images of the same size
as the input image can be binned in the same way.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><dfn>Error-threshold</dfn></td>
<td>The maximum fractional error allowed on the value of a
bin.</td></tr>

<tr><td><dfn>Combined colour</dfn></td>
<td>Ratio of the counts in a bin in several different bands,
[(0/1)/2]/3... (See Sanders &amp; Fabian, accepted)</td></tr>
