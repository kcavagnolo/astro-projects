This directory contains a small library for the manipulation
of FITS images. It is Copyright (C) Jeremy Sanders, 2000 and released
under the GNU Public licence. See the file COPYING for details.

It is not very pretty, but does the job. I am writing a much
better replacement at the moment. It was written when my C++
knowledge wasn't that great.

It allows you to do things like:

CFITSImage image1;
{
 CFITSFile myfile("hello.fits", CFITSFile::existingro);
 image1 = myfile.GetImage();
}

image1.Sqrt();

{
 CFITSFile outfile("out.fits", CFITSFile::create);
 outfile.SetImage(image1);
 outfile.SetPosn(myfile.GetPosn());
 outfile.WriteImage();
}

Have fun. Do let me know if it's any use.
