\end{center}
\section{Abstract}
We propose a detailed study of the intracluster medium surrounding and
nuclear point source of IRAS 09104+4109. IRAS 09104+4109 is a rare
hyperluminous infrared brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the rich
cluster MACS J0913.7+4056 as it likely hosts a ``changing-look'' AGN
and the highest redshift AGN blown bubbles known to date. The
environment surrounding the BCG is best described as extreme, with
canabalized companion galaxies, stripped gas, the most powerful radio
source of any IRAS object, and an AGN which has established a new
beaming direction in the last 70 kyrs. Understanding the relationship
of the host galaxy, AGN, and ICM in this peculiar and unique object
will aide in developing better models for coupling together galaxy
formation, AGN feedback, and the large scale cluster environment.
IRAS 09104+4109 is an ideal test case of a very short-lived but highly
active stage of cluster and central galaxy formation.
