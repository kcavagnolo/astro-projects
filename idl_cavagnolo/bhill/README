                                                        11 Dec 2001
                                                        
This directory contains the procedures XCTV, XCTV2, XCTVN,
XINSPECT, XINSPECT2, and supporting procedures.  These are
object-oriented display widgets for roaming, zooming, scaling and
examining pixel values in an image.  XCTV is used for a single
image, while XCTV2 is for examining two images simultaneously.
XCTVN is used for examining two or more images simultaneously (the
images are overlaid -- mapped and unmapped in widgetspeak --
rather than displayed side by side).  XINSPECT and XINSPECT2 are
for examining huge FITS images on disk, and work without reading
the whole thing in.

These have been tested, but not systematically, under various
versions of IDL 5, the latest being 5.5.

Several IDL Astronomy Library routines are called.

These routines use the non-standard system variables !TEXTUNIT and
!TEXTOUT in the IDL Astronomy Library.  These can be defined using
the IDL Astronomy Library procedure astrolib.pro.

The non-standard system variable !DUMP is no longer required.

Updates:

11-Dec-2001:  Aspect ratio of input image preserved in pan window
              for XCTV, XCTV2, XCTVN.  Propagation of XCOLORS
              events fixed.

30-Jan-2001:  New widgets XCTVN, XINSPECT, XINSPECT2.  Small changes
              intended to decrease user irritation.

29-Dec-2000:  Use xdispstr instead of xdisplayfile, better logfile manipulation
              New "Multi" button in XCTV2, various minor fixes

29-Sep-2000: Added aperture photometry, statistics on entire image

01-Sep-2000: Added Blinking and 24bit color awareness.   (Now uses XCOLOR 
             from David Fanning's Library).

03-Jul-2000:  Converted to square bracket notation, somewhat better doc headers,
	     especially on the topic of object orientation, and cleaner error
	     handling in a few places

30-Jun-2000: Force pan window to have same scaling as main window.   Added
             logging of output data

12-Oct-1999: Allowed headers to be positional parameters:
             Eliminated some unused code
