This directory contains the procedure TCTOOL and supporting procedures.  This
is a Widget Tool which is useful in creating a "True Color" image, given a red,
green, and blue image of the same field.    User has the ability to 
interactively scale, rotate, shift, trim, and edit the three images to optimize
the true-color image.    Requires a 24 bit graphics display. (Eliot Malumuth,
Raytheon)

An alternate widget tool "TRUCOLOR" for displaying and printing true color
images is available from the NICMOS software library at
