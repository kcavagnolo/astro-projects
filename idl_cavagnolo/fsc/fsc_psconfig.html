<CENTER><h1>Configuring the PostScript Device</h1></CENTER>

<p>The <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is a 
program for configuring the IDL PostScript device. The
program is similar to (but much more powerful than) <B>PS_Form</B>, an older program offered 
by Fanning Software Consulting. The <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is written as an object. 

<p>In addition to configuring
the PostScript device, the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program 
allows you to keep track of the current state of the PostScript device at all times. 
European users will be pleased to know that support for the A4 page and
centimeter units are built into the program and can easily be set as program defaults.
One of the most useful features of the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program 
is its ability to collect user input via a graphical user interface, which--on a Windows
machine with a 24-bit graphics display--looks similar to the illustration below.

<H2><A NAME="OVERVIEW">Program Overview</A></H2>

<p>How you use the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is completely up to you.
It has been designed to accommodate  different programming styles. For example, it can be
called from the IDL command line or from within other IDL programs. Typically,
the program is used by initializing the object (you can have as many of the objects as you
like, so each program can have its own PostScript configuration setup), 
gathering user input via the built-in Graphical User Interface (GUI), configuring the PostScript device, 
and drawing your PostScript plot.
Here is a typical sequence of commands. Each step will be explained in detail below,
but this is a short overview of a typical session. (Users uninterested in the power
of the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> object can access most of the functionality through the
<A HREF="#WRAPPER"><b>PSConfig</b></A> wrapper function described below.)

<H3>Initializing the Object</H3>

<P>The first step is to initialize the object. There are a number of keywords
that can be used to set properties of the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> object, but suppose you are going
to leave it up to the user to determine exactly how the PostScript device should
be configured. Then you might simply initialize the object like this:

<PRE>
   psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSConfig")
</PRE>

<P>If you typically display PostScript output on an A4 page and prefer
size and offset units to be displayed in centimeters rather than inches,
then you can initialize the object with the <B>European</B> keyword set, like
this. 
<PRE>
   psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSConfig", /European)
</PRE>

<P>The A4 page and centimeter units are now the default for this object.
Selecting a European style can also be selected via a check box
on the graphical user interface.

<H3>Gathering User Input</H3>

<P>Next, you might gather the user's input into how he or she would
like the PostScript device to be configured. You can do this
with a graphical user interface in either modal (blocking) or 
non-modal mode. Suppose you wish the program to wait for the user's input.
You would invoke the graphical user interface in blocking mode with this command:

<PRE>
   psObject->GUI
</PRE>

<H3>Configuring the PostScript Device</H3>

<P>The real purpose of the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> object is to return
keywords that are appropriate for the PostScript device. The way the
PostScript device is configured is to make the PostScript device the
current graphics device, and then pass these keywords to the PostScript
device via the <B>Device</B> command using the "keyword inheritance"
mechanism and the <B>_Extra</B> keyword. The keywords are obtained from the
object by calling the <b>GetKeywords</b> method. A typical sequence of
commands looks like this:

<PRE>
   thisDevice = !D.Name
   Set_Plot, "PS"
   Device, _Extra=psObject->GetKeywords()
</PRE>

<H3>Drawing the PostScript Graphics</H3>

<p>The PostScript graphics are now written to the PostScript file in
the normal way. (Here a simple <b>Plot</b> command is used, but the graphics command
or commands can be as elaborate as you like.)

<PRE>
   Plot, data
</PRE>

<H3>Cleaning Up</H3>

<P>The final step is to clean up. Note that you do not have to
destroy the object, as shown here. In fact, you may want to keep
the object around for the entire IDL session, so you always know
the current configuration of the PostScript device. Repeated calls
to invoke the graphical user interface will show the current
state of the PostScript device. Typical clean-up commands will be
similar to these:

<PRE>
   Device, /Close_File
   Set_Plot, thisDevice
   Obj_Destroy, psObject
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="METHODS">Using the Program</A></H2>

<p>The <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is used by calling the program's object methods. This section
provides a detailed description of the object methods available to the user. (There are
a number of other methods in the object that are used internally to run the program and 
should not normally be accessed by the user of the program. These are not described here,
although they are extensively documented in the source code.)

<H3><A NAME="INIT">Initializing the Program</A></H3>

<P>The object is initialized by creating an object of the <B>FSC_PSCONFIG</B> object class:

<PRE>
   psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSConfig")
</PRE>

<p>At the time the object is initialized, various keywords can be used to set
properties of the object. These keywords are typically (but not exclusively) the same keywords that
can be used to configure the PostScript device (i.e., the keywords appropriate
for the <B>Device</B> command when the PostScript device is the current graphics
device). Here is a complete description of the <B>INIT</B> method keywords you can use.

<UL>

</UL>

<p>For example, to select a centered, color, encapsulated PostScript file, using the Times Bold PostScript
font, and named <em>myplot.eps</em>, you can initialize the object like this:

<PRE>
   psObject = Obj_New("FSC_PSConfig", /Color, /Encapsulate, /Times, /Bold, Filename="myplot.eps")
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="GUI">Description of the Graphical User Interface</A></H3>

<P>The program's graphical user interface is invoked by calling the object's <B>GUI</B>
method, like this:

<PRE>
   psObject->GUI
</PRE>

<p>Keywords are available with this method that control how the
graphical user interfaces appears and what properties it has. Called as above,
the interface is a blocking widget. This means the IDL command line will block
and user will be unable to enter IDL commands at the command line until the widget
is dismissed by clicking either the <em>Cancel</em> or the <em>Accept</em> button.
Valid keywords for this method are these:

<UL>
<LI><B>Cancel</B> - Set this output keyword to a named variable that will be set to 1 if the user
selected the <em>Cancel</em> button, and to 0 if the user selected the <em>Accept</Em> button. Note that
this value only has meaning when the widget is is blocking (or modal) mode. In non-modal mode, the value
is always set to 0.

<PRE>
      psObject->GUI, Group_Leader=event.top, Cancel=cancelled
</PRE>

<LI><B>FontInfo</B> - This keyword is set if you want the user to be able to
configure the PostScript device with font information as well. Please see the
description of how to use font information below, but the graphical interface will
look similar to this.

<PRE>
      psObject->GUI, FontInfo=1
</PRE>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic3.jpg" 
ALT="The FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface with the font information displayed."></CENTER>

<p>Users have the ability to select Hershey, Hardware, or True-Type fonts, as well as many
font "properties".


<LI><B>Group_Leader</B> - Set this keyword to the identifier of a widget which is the group leader for
the graphical user interface. This keyword <em>must</em> be set if you want modal (as opposed to just 
blocking) behavior from the program. In other words, you will probably <em>always</em> set this keyword
if you are calling the GUI from within another widget program. For example, from within a widget program,
the graphical user interface should be invoked like this:

<PRE>
      psObject->GUI, Group_Leader=event.top
</PRE>


<LI><B>NoBlock</B> - This keyword is set if you want non-modal, and non-blocking
behavior from the program. This is the mode you would use, for example, if you want
the graphical user interface to stay on the display so you can change the PostScript
set-up at will. Notice that in this mode the <em>Cancel</em> button is named <em>Dismiss</em>
and the <em>Accept</em> button is named <em>Apply</em>.

<PRE>
      psObject->GUI, /NoBlock
</PRE>

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic2.jpg" 
ALT="The FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface in non-modal and non-saved mode."></CENTER>


<p>In non-modal mode, selecting the <em>Apply</em> button will save the current PostScript
configuration. Note that the PostScript graphics window changes background color if the
current configuration shown on the form is not currently saved. (The program is shown in its
 unsaved condition in the illustration
above.) Upon saving the configuration,
the background color will change back to its default color. The <em>Revert</em> button will
revert to the last saved configuration.
</UL>

<H4>The Left Panel</H4>

<p>The left panel of the graphical user interface contains eight droplist widgets
and looks like this. A description of each droplist follows the illustration.

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic4.jpg" 
ALT="The left panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface."></CENTER>



<UL>
<LI><B>Page Size</B> - This droplist controls the page size. It should be set to the type of output
you intend to print, since offsets and sizes will be based on the page size selected. This will be
set to "Letter" by default, unless the <b>European</b> keyword has been set, in which case 
the "A4" option is the default.
<LI><B>Orientation</B> - This droplist controls whether the page will be in portrait or landscape
oreintation. The <b>Portrait</b> and <b>Landscape</b> Device keywords are set from this droplist.
<LI><B>Units</B> - This droplist controls whether the size and offsets are measured in inches or centimeters.
The <b>Inches</b> Device keyword is set from this droplist.
<LI><B>Encapsulation</B> - This droplist controls whether <b>Encapsulated</b> Device keyword is set. If
encapsulation is turned <em>Off</em>, then the <b>Preview Mode</b> droplist is insensitive.

<LI><B>Preview Mode</B> - This droplist selects the value of the <b>Preview</b> Device keyword. 
It is sensitive to user input only if the <em>Encapsulation</em> droplist is turned <em>On</em>
"None" sets the keyword to 0, "ESPI" sets the keyword to 1, and "ESPF" sets the
keyword to 2. If you wish IDL to create a preview image for Macintoshs or PCs, then you should choose
the "ESPF" option.

<LI><B>Color Output</B> - This droplist controls whether <b>Color</b> Device keyword is set. 
<LI><B>Bits Per Image Pixel</B> - This droplist controls the value of the <b>Bits_Per_Pixel</b> 
Device keyword. 
<LI><B>Default Setups</B> - This droplist selects the various default set-ups, which 
change multiple program settings at once. The choices in this droplist are easily modified by
the user in the source code. Typically they would be choices in use at your facility.
<LI><B>European Style</B> - This checkbox controls the Page Size and Units keywords. If checked,
an A4 page size is used, and centimeters are used for Units. 
</UL>

<H4>The Center Panel</H4>

<P>The center panel of the graphical user interface contains the size and offset
information, directions for operating the PostScript "plot", and fields to
indicate the output directory and file names. It looks similar to the
illustration below. An explanation of each item follows the illustration.


<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic5.jpg" 
ALT="The center panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface."></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><B>X Size</B> - This text field contains the X size of the PostScript "window". Its value is
used to set the <B>XSize</B> Device keyword. After entering a value in this field you <em>must</em>
enter a carriage return in the field for the new information to be transmitted to the plot window
in the right panel.

<LI><B>Y Size</B> - This text field contains the Y size of the PostScript "window". Its value is
used to set the <B>YSize</B> Device keyword. After entering a value in this field you <em>must</em>
enter a carriage return in the field for the new information to be transmitted to the plot window
in the right panel.

<LI><B>X Offset</B> - This text field contains the X offset of the PostScript "window". Its value is
used to set the <B>XOffset</B> Device keyword. After entering a value in this field you <em>must</em>
enter a carriage return in the field for the new information to be transmitted to the plot window
in the right panel. Offsets are always calculated from the lower-left corner of the page regardless of
the orientation, unlike the way you configure the PostScript device. The complexities of PostScript
are handled behind the scenes and are not passed along to unsuspecting end-users. 

<LI><B>Y Offset</B> - This text field contains the Y offset of the PostScript "window". Its value is
used to set the <B>YOffset</B> Device keyword. After entering a value in this field you <em>must</em>
enter a carriage return in the field for the new information to be transmitted to the plot window
in the right panel. Offsets are always calculated from the lower-left corner of the page regardless of
the orientation, unlike the way you configure the PostScript device. The complexities of PostScript
are handled behind the scenes and are not passed along to unsuspecting end-users. 

<LI><B>Directory</B> - The name of the directory where the PostScript file is to be
written. The <em>Browse</em> button following the text field calls the IDL <b>Dialog_Pickfile</b>
command with the <b>Directory</B> keyword set for directory selection.

<LI><B>Filename</B> - The name of the output PostScript file. The <em>Browse</em> button 
following the text field calls the IDL <b>Dialog_Pickfile</b>
command for file selection. The <em>Directory</em> and
<em>Filename</em> values are put together to constuct the value of the Device <B>Filename</B>
keyword. 

</UL>

<p>If the <b>FontInfo</b> keyword is set when the graphical user interface is invoked, the
center panel may also contain graphical elements allowing user input into font selections.
These additional fields are described below the illustration.

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic6.jpg" 
ALT="The center panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface with font information turned on."></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><B>Font Type</B> - This droplist sets the font type. The other font options 
are available only if the <em>Font Type</Em> droplist
selection is set to something other than the "Vector (Hershey)".
Note that the <em>Font Type</Em> droplist default selection depends upon the
value of the <B>!P.Font</B> system variable when the graphical user interface
is invoked, although it can be also be set via a <b>FontType</b> keyword when the grahical
user interface is invoked. For example, the illustration above was produced with
this syntax:
<PRE>
   IDL> psObject->GUI, /FontInfo, FontType=1
</PRE>

<LI><B>Font</B> - This droplist allows selection of one of the 10 font families
available on most PostScript printers. A selection here sets the corresponding
Device keyword.

<LI><B>Font Style Box</B> - This non-exclusive base allows you to set the eight
font styles that can be set for the PostScript device. These font styles are applied
to the font selection described above to modify it with the selected style. 
Note that which font styles are available for
which font family is not controlled by IDL, but is a function of the fonts installed
on your computer or printer. Thus, you must use this information carefully. The corresponding
Device keyword is set according to each style selection.

<LI><B>Clear Font Styles</B> - This button clears all the font style attributes
selections described above.

<LI><B>Font Size</B> - This droplist allows you to select the font size in point
sizes from 6 to 36. The default size is 12. The <b>FontSize</B> Device keyword is
set to this value.

<LI><B>True-Type</B> - This droplist sets the Device <b>True_Type</B> keyword. If it is
turned on true-type fonts are used for output if they are available.

<LI><B>ISOlatin1</B> - This droplist sets the Device <b>ISOlatin1</B> keyword. If it is
turned on isolatin encoding is used for output. This allows output in many languages other
than English.

</UL>

<H4>The Right Panel</H4>

<P>The right panel of the graphical user interface contains the representation of
the PostScript page. This window will change shape and size as different page sizes and orientations
are selected. It looks similar to the illustration below. (Note that the colors you see here will only
appear on 24-bit displays. On 8-bit displays the colors are less exciting.)


<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic7.jpg" 
ALT="The righ panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface."></CENTER>

<p>The "plot" in the window can be moved and resized by the user. It represents
the "window" on the PostScript page where graphics will be drawn. As such, it controls
the <B>XSize</B>, <B>YSize</B>, <B>XOffset</B>, and <B>YOffset</B> Device keywords.
The plot window can be moved by clicking somewhere inside it and dragging. If you locate
the cursor near an edge of the plot, you can click and drag to resize the window. Cursor changes
will occur to indicate whether you are in drag or resize mode. Notice
as you do that the size and offset fields in the right panel are updated with the new
window sizes and offsets. Notice that the background color of the window changes if
the current configuration shown on the form hasn't been saved and the program is in non-blocking
mode. It will look similar to
the illustration below. The backgound color does not change if the graphical user interface
is in blocking mode. (Non-blocking mode is selected with the <b>NoBlock</B> keyword when the
graphical user interface is invoked.)

<p>The plot window can be centered in the page by clicking the middle mouse button
anywhere inside the PostScript page representation. Note that the middle mouse button
can be simulated if you don't have a three-button mouse. For example, on PCs a <em>Ctrl-Click</em>
is interpreted as a middle mouse click. <em>Option-Click</em> on a Macintosh will do the same.

<p>If the <em>Color Output</em> droplist is turned <em>On</em>, then the plot
is shown in color as a visual clue to the color property.

<p>The action button panel looks different, depending upon whether the graphical user
interface is is blocking (modal) mode or in  non-blocking mode. Here is what it looks
like in non-blocking mode.

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic9.jpg" 
ALT="The button panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface in non-blocking mode."></CENTER>

<P>Here is how it appears in blocking mode. 

<!-- ************** GRAPHIC EXAMPLE ************-->
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/docs/fsc_psconfig_pic10.jpg" 
ALT="The button panel of the FSC_PSConfig graphical user interface in blocking mode."></CENTER>

<p>Notice that in blocking mode the <em>Dismiss</em> button is named <em>Cancel</em> and
the <em>Apply</em> button is named <em>Accept</em>, but they have similar functions. The only
real difference is that the <em>Accept</em> button destroys the widget (as do the <em>Dismiss</em>
and <em>Cancel</em> buttons), while the <em>Apply</em> button does not. 

<UL>
<LI><B>Dismiss</B> or <B>Cancel</B> - This button destroys the graphical user interface.
The last saved configuration of the graphical user interface is in effect.

<LI><B>Revert</B> - This button restores the last saved configuration of the graphical
user interface. A configuration is saved when the <em>Apply</em> or <em>Accept</em>
button is selected.

<LI><B>Help</B> - This button provides a Help message to the user and points the
user to the program documentation. This action may have been customized for your facility.

<LI><B>Apply</B> or <B>Accept</B> - This button saves the current configuration of the 
graphical user interface. If the button is the <em>Accept</em> button, the graphical user
interface is also destroyed and the block released.

<P> Note that the name of this button can be changed by using the <B>Accept_Button_Name</B>
keyword when the graphical user interface is invoked. For example, you might want to name
the button "Print". You would do it like this:

<PRE>
   IDL> psObject->GUI, Accept_Button_Name='Print'
</PRE>
</UL>

<p>The buttons would now look like this:

<H3><A NAME="KEYWORDS">Setting PostScript Configuration Keywords</A></H3>

<P>The whole purpose of the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is to configure the PostScript device
by setting the appropriate <b>Device</B> command keywords. This is done by obtaining a structure in which
the fields of the structure are the names of the appropriate keywords, and the values of the fields are
appropriate for configuring the device the way you want it configured. You pass this structure to the 
<b>Device</B> command  by means of <em>keyword inheritance</em>. In other words, you use the <b>_Extra</b>
keyword to accept the structure. 

<p>The keyword structure is obtained from the object by calling the <b>GetKeywords</b> method, like
this:

<PRE>
   keywordStructure = psObject->GetKeywords()
</PRE>

<p>To verify what this structure looks like, type this:

<PRE>
   IDL> Help, keywordStructure, /Structure
</PRE>

<P>Depending upon how your object is configured, you should see something like this:

<PRE>
   ** Structure <15037f8>, 24 tags, length=68, refs=1:
      BITS_PER_PIXEL  INT              8
      COLOR           INT              0
      ENCAPSULATED    INT              0
      FILENAME        STRING    'D:\RSI\IDL53\DAVID\coyote.ps'
      FONT_SIZE       INT             12

      YSIZE           FLOAT           4.00000
      PORTRAIT        INT              1
      LANDSCAPE       INT              0
      HELVETICA       INT              1
      BOLD            INT              1
      BOOK            INT              0
      DEMI            INT              0
      ITALIC          INT              1
      LIGHT           INT              0
      MEDIUM          INT              0
      NARROW          INT              0
      OBLIQUE         INT              0
</PRE>

<p>Note that your structure may have other keywords defined, depending upon
how your object is configured. This is typical.

<p>These keywords are passed to the PostScript device via the <b>_Extra</b> keyword
to the <b>Device</B> command. Be sure to select the PostScript device first. The code
will typically look something like this:

<PRE>
   thisDevice = !D.Name
   Set_Plot, "PS"
   Device, _Extra=psObject->GetKeywords()
</PRE>

<P>Once the PostScript device is configured, you issue your graphics
command or commands as normal. They will go into the PostScript "window" you
have described on the PostScript page. Then, be sure to close the file. The code might look
something like this:

<PRE>
   Plot, data, Title='Experiment 5A'
   Device, /Close_File
   Set_Plot, thisDevice
</PRE>

<H4>A Note About Fonts</H4> 

<p>Although the PostScript device allows you to set information about PostScript fonts 
(if you set the <b>FontInfo</B> keyword when you invoked the GUI),
there is no guarantee that your graphics commands will be rendered in PostScript fonts.
In fact, this is a function of the <b>!P.Font</b> system variable or the <b>Font</B> keyword
on a graphics command, and has nothing to do with how the PostScript device
is configured <em>per se</em>. This makes it a bit tricky to put font property widgets on a graphical
user interface, since the unaware user may be surprised that the output doesn't look like
the configuration he or she selected.

<p>I've attempted to get around this problem by letting you know of the
user's wishes for font type. But this information doesn't come back in the
device keyword structure. Rather, it is returned in a <b>FontType</B> output keyword
from the <b>GetKeywords</b> method. In fact, I recommend you always call the method
like this when you have asked the user to specify font information in the GUI:

<PRE>
   thisDevice = !D.Name
   Set_Plot, "PS"
   Device, _Extra=psObject->GetKeywords(<B>FontType=fonttype</B>)
</PRE>

<p>This allows you to set the font type correctly on your graphics commands. For example,
you could write code like this:

<PRE>
   currentFontType = !P.Font
   <b>!P.Font = fonttype</b>
   Plot, data, Title='Experiment 5A'
   Device, /Close_File
   Set_Plot, thisDevice
   !P.Font = currentFontType
</PRE>

<p>Or, even more simply, you could write code like this:

<PRE>
   Plot, data, Title='Experiment 5A', <b>Font=fonttype</B>
   Device, /Close_File
   Set_Plot, thisDevice
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="CLEANUP">Cleaning Up the Program</A></H3>

<P>Since the <b>FSC_PSConfig</B> program is an object, it is persistent in
the IDL session. This is one of the huge advantages of objects. For example,
you can create an PostScript configuration object in a start-up file and
always have it available in your IDL session. You will always have access
to the current configuration of the PostScript device.

<p>But as a persistent entity, you must destroy it when you are done with
it or you will have heap memory leaking in your IDL session. This is especially
true if you create these objects in other program modules. This is no different for
other memory-leaking entities: pointers, pixmaps, etc. The way you clean up an object
is to destroy it with the <b>Obj_Destroy</b> command, like this:

<PRE>
   Obj_Destroy, psObject
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="EXAMPLE">Example Program using <b>FSC_PSConfig</B></A></H2>

<P>Sometimes the best way to see how to use a new program is to see an example.
Here is an example program, named <A HREF="http://www.dfanning.com/tip_examples/ps_plotter.pro">PS_Plotter</A>,
that uses the <b>FSC_PSConfig</B> object to create a window on the PostScript page 
for two plots: an image plot
and a histogram plot of the image data. You will need another useful program from
my library to run the program: <A HREF="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/tvimage.pro">TVImage</A>. 
(<B>TVImage</b> is needed because the normal IDL <b>TV</B> command doesn't honor
the <b>!P.Multi</b> system variable. Nor is the <b>TV</B> command written in the
device-independent way required here.) Here is the compete code for the <b>PS_Plotter</b>
program.

<PRE>
   PRO PS_Plotter, image, $
      European=european, $   ; Set this keyword if you want European measurements.
      Object=object          ; Output variable to return FSC_PSConfig object.

      ; Get an image if one is not passed in.

   IF N_Elements(image) EQ 0 THEN BEGIN
      image = BytArr(360, 360)
      file = Filepath(SubDirectory=['examples', 'data'], 'worldelv.dat')
      OpenR, lun, file, /Get_Lun
      ReadU, lun, image
      Free_Lun, lun
   ENDIF 

      ; Create the PostScript configuration object.

   object = Obj_New('FSC_PSConfig', European=Keyword_Set(european))

      ; We want hardware fonts.

   thisFontType = !P.Font
   !P.Font = 1

      ; Get user input to PostScript configuration.

   object->GUI

      ; Configure the PostScript Device.

   thisDevice = !D.Name
   Set_Plot, 'PS'
   keywords = object->GetKeywords(FontType=fonttype)
   Device, _Extra=keywords

      ; Draw the example plots.

   !P.Multi = [ 0, 1, 2]
   TVImage, image
   Plot, Histogram(image), Title='Example Histogram Plot', XTitle='Pixel Value', $
      YTitle='Number of Pixels', XStyle=1, Max_Value=5000

      ; Clean up.

   !P.Multi = 0
   Device, /Close_File
   Set_Plot, thisDevice
   !P.Font = thisfontType

      ; Return the PS_Configuration object or destroy it.

   IF Arg_Present(object) EQ 0 THEN Obj_Destroy, object
   END
</PRE>

<p>If you will be printing on letter-size paper, you want to run the program
like this. You will see the graphical user interface of the object in the
middle of your display. Fill out the form the way you would like the output
file to be configured and click the <em>Accept</em> button.

<PRE>
   IDL> PS_Plotter
</PRE>

<P>If you are in a country that uses A4 paper, you might want to
call the program like this:

<PRE>
   IDL> PS_Plotter, /European
</PRE>

<p>A PostScript file will be created in the specified directory. You 
can print it or use a PostScript file viewer (e.g., Ghostview) to view
the file.

<p>Called as above, the <b>FSC_PSConfig</b> object is created and destroyed
when the program exits. However, you may wish to play around with some of the
object's properties. You can return the object from the <b>PS_Plotter</b> program by
using the optional <b>Object</b> keyword, like this:

<PRE>
   IDL> PS_Plotter, Object=psObject
</PRE>

<p>If you want to see how the PostScript file
was just configured, you can examine the PostScript Device keywords
that were used to create the file:

<PRE>
   IDL> Help, psObject->GetKeywords(), /Structure
</PRE>

<P>Be sure to destroy the object when you are finished with it.

<PRE>
   IDL> Obj_Destroy, psObject
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="WRAPPER">A Wrapper Function for <b>FSC_PSConfig</b></A></H2>

<P>A number of people are still uncomfortable using objects. So for those
people, I have written a function named <A HREF="http://www.dfanning.com/programs/psconfig.pro">PSConfig</A>,
which acts very much like (in fact, can probably be used as a replacement for)
the old PostScript configuration program, <b>PS_Form</B>.

<p>The <B>PSConfig</b> program creates the <b>FSC_PSConfig</b> object, calls
the graphical user interface in blocking mode, and then returns the device
keywords necessary to configure the PostScript device. The program can be used
with commands similar to these:

<PRE>
   keywords = PSConfig(Cancel=cancelled)
   IF NOT cancelled THEN BEGIN
      thisDevice = !D.Name
      Set_Plot, "PS"
      Device, _Extra=keywords
      Plot, Findgen(11)
      Device, /Close_File
      Set_Plot, thisDevice
   ENDIF
</PRE>

<p> You can use the same keywords with <b>PSConfig</B> that 
you use for the <b>FSC_PSConfig</B> object.

<H2><A NAME="CUSTOMIZING">Customizing Your Source Code</A></H2>

<P>I've tried to write the <B>FSC_PSConfig</B> program in such a way that it can be
easily customized and extended by you at your site. In particular, it will be easy to
add new default set-ups and other page types to the program. The
code itself is extensively documented to indicate how this can
be done. But, to give you an example, here is how you would add another
default set-up, named <em>Company Viewgraph</em> to the code.

<h3>Step 1: Add the Name to the Set-Up List</H3>

<P>Open the <em>fsc_psconfig__define.pro</em> file and find the
<em>DefaultList</em> method. (For example, search for "::DefaultList".)
Add your new default name to the list shown there. For example, you would find this code:

<PRE>
defaultlist = [ 'System (Portrait)', $
                'System (Landscape)', $
                'Centered (Portrait)', $
                'Centered (Landscape)', $
                'Square (Portrait)', $
                'Square (Landscape)', $
                'Figure (Small)', $
                'Figure (Large)', $
                'Color (Portrait)', $
                'Color (Landscape)' ]
</PRE>

<p>and change it to this:

<PRE>
defaultlist = [ 'System (Portrait)', $
                'System (Landscape)', $
                'Centered (Portrait)', $
                'Centered (Landscape)', $
                'Square (Portrait)', $
                'Square (Landscape)', $
                'Figure (Small)', $
                'Figure (Large)', $
                'Color (Portrait)', $
                'Color (Landscape)' <b>, $
                'Company Viewgraph'</b>]
</PRE>

<H3>Step 2: Create the New Set-Up</H3>

<p>Next, find the <em>SetDefault</em> method (it will be just below the
<em>DefaultList</em> method you just found) and copy one of the defualt
setups you find in the CASE statement in that code. For example, here
is the <em>System (Portrait)</em> method found there:

<PRE>
CASE thisDefault OF

   'System (Portrait)': BEGIN
         self.bitsSet = '8'
         self.colorSet = 0
         self.directorySet = directoryName
         self.encapsulationSet = 0
         self.filenameSet = defaultFilename + ".ps"
         self.fonttypeSet = !P.Font
         self.fontsizeSet = 12
         self.fontStyleSet = Replicate(0, 8)
         self.fontnameSet = "Helvetica"
         self.inchesSet = units
         self.landscapeSet = 0
         self.isolatinSet = 0
         self.pagetypeSet = pagetype
         self.previewSet = 0
         self.truetypeSet = 0
         IF self.european THEN self.xoffsetSet = 1.61 ELSE self.xoffsetSet = 0.75
         IF self.european THEN self.yoffsetSet = 14.65 ELSE self.yoffsetSet = 5.0
         IF self.european THEN self.xsizeSet = 17.80 ELSE self.xsizeSet = 7.0
         IF self.european THEN self.ysizeSet = 12.70 ELSE self.ysizeSet = 5.0
         self.defaultsSet = 'System (Portrait)'
      ENDCASE
</PRE>

<p>Modify each of the fields you want to change there, and add your changed
values to the CASE statement. For example, your
<em>Company Viewgraph</em> set-up might be defined like this. Note that you
will have to provide both inches and centimeter units for the sizes and offsets.
