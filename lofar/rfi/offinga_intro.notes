Hi Kenneth,

Nice to "meet" you :-). Just to give a brief summary: I am a
phd-student doing my thesis on RFI mitigation techniques. I have
tested most of the available methods of removing RFI after correlation
for LOFAR and am somewhat involved in pre-correlation blanking
algorithms. I also wrote the "AOFlagger", which is currently being
implemented in the LOFAR pipeline.

I was not aware we actually had an RFI group ;-) ; many people are
dealing / finding out about RFI issues. I guess me and David are most
into and involved in the flagger and RFI statistics.

To answer your questions:
1) and 2) I think the areas which would require most attention and
maybe can use more menpower are station RFI cancellation and
correlator implementation of an RFI algorithm. Also, testing and
characterization of current RFI problems might be helpful, although I
think that overlaps with what David is doing(?). I am currently
working on RFI characterisation (at what time/frequency/level/baseline
occurs what RFI), tweaking the flagger and some filtering techniques.

3) I would recommend reading "A LOFAR RFI detection pipeline and its
first results" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2089 ) on the current RFI
pipeline and more or less scanning "Post-correlation radio frequency
interference classification methods" ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.1957
) to see how the flagger works.

I have looked at fringe filtering for LOFAR data as described by
Athreya. The fringe filtering techniques of Athreya are not really
applicable on LOFAR data, because LOFAR is not seeing any visible
broadband, static RFI. The GMRT is seeing severely strong RFI of that
kind, which is a prerequisite for the method, and is why it works so
well at the GMRT. As soon as RFI is much below the noise, filtering a
Fourier component from individual baselines with the additional
freedom of allowing it to change with time, the method is doing more
harm than that it solves. I am actually in the way of writing an
article on fringe fundamentals where I describe such issues.
