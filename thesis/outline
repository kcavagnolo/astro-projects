Introduction:

what are clusters?
	- gravitationally bound collections of galaxies
	- made of dark matter, hot icm, galaxies, stars

why should you care about clusters?
	- important as unique constraint in cosmo studies
		+ growth of structure sensitive to DE
		+ structure growth lies orthogonal to other constraints
	- testbed for theories of hierarchical structure formation
		+ gravitational heating
		+ radiative cooling
		+ feedback

what are the problems needing study?
	- need to weigh clusters
		+ mass-observables have large dispersion
		+ need to quantify and calibrate for dispersion
		+ wide ranging implications 
			~ large surveys need accurate mass surrogate
			~ dN/dz contaminated by scatter in L and T
			~ DE EOS degeneracy broken w/ cluster growth?
	- breaking of self-similarity
		+ radiative cooling sets scale for SS breaking
		+ feedback results from cooling... but how?
		+ AGN feedback models
		+ star formation
		+ wide ranging implications
			~ end of cooling flow problem
			~ heating of ICM
			~ truncation of GLF
			~ model coupling of feedback and cooling

Clusters Primer:
	- DM
		+ NFW dist.
		+ defining quant of cluster
		+ virial theorem
	- Galaxies
		+ population of gals
		+ effect of ICM on gals
	- Stars
		+ forming stars in cD galaxy
		+ forming stars in ICM
	- ICM
		+ what is it?
		+ where does it come from?
		+ how do we observe it? (emission processes)
			~ basic x-ray eqns
			~ therm Brem
			~ line emission
			~ sb
		+ what can we learn from observations
			~ temp
			~ dens
			~ pressure
			~ cooling times
			~ entropy
			~ mass
