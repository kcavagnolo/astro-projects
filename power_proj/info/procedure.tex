\section{Power Ratios}
\begin{description}
\item normalize image of cluster with exposure map\\
	- exposure maps weighted by raymond-smith N$_H =
3\times10^{20} cm^{-2}$, kT$ = 5$ keV, and Z$/Z_{\odot} = 0.3$.
\item pt src holes filled using dmfilth
\item exclude or include central sbr pt src, doesn't make significant
change to ratios.
\item compare soft band flux vs. RASS R4-R5 band flux for soft excess
\item make two instrument only (no mirror or QE) exposure maps for each bgd\\
	- one with bgd bad pixels\\
	- one with obs bad pixels\\
	- divide bgd image by bgd bad pixel exposure map\\
	- then multiply bgd image by obs bad pixel exp map\\
	- correct bgd image by full obs exposure map
\item calculate centroid (location where P1 vanishes) in largest aperture
\item calculate image moment, img$_i$
\item calculate bgd image moment, bgd$_i$
\item subtract bgd power from image power for net moment, $m_i = (img_i-bgd_i)$
\item calculate power from net moment, p$_i$
\end{description}

\section{Error Estimate via bootstrap Monte Carlo}
\begin{description}
\item adaptively bin (a.b.) exposure corrected image to minimal S/N (like 2) to remove almost all zeroes from image
\item multiply a.b. image by exposure map to reintroduce instrumental effects
\item add Poission noise to each pixel by making pixel value the mean of a Poission distribution and then randomly selecting a new pixel value from that distr.
\item exposure correct the image
\item repeat 100 times for each image

** for clusters with bgd moments similar to image moment, also perform the BsMC for bgd image

\item calculate power ratio for each of 100 BsMC images
\item define 90\% conf. as the fifth highest and fifth lowest ratios

** pt srcs not included as they introduce a max of 13\% total flux

\item compare 0.7-7.0 flux in obs to 0.7-7.0 flux in bgd
\item determine possible change in flux, ie: 0.9-1.2
\item run error calculation on bgd images with normalization of 0.9
and 1.2; ie use 0.9*bgd in BsMC routine and 1.2*bgd in BsMC
\item define sys err as difference between avg of 100 power ratios
calculated with orig bgd and avg of 100 power ratios calculated with
renormalized bgd.
