Dear Editor:

Below is our reply to the referee's report for MN-10-1576-MJ. The referee's comments are in quotes. Please note that the revised manuscript contains revisions substantially beyond those requested/suggested by the referee.

========================

``Unfortunately, a decrement or an excess over a particular model is only meaningful if that model is itself physically meaningful, and in the present work, the authors provide no evidence to support the physicality of the particular model which is fitted.  By inspection of the residual image (Fig 5), what is immediately apparent is that the excess is oriented roughly east-west, while the decrements are oriented in an almost exactly perpendicular direction. This is exactly what is expected when fitting a model which does not have the correct shape. (An example would be fitting such a model to an image which has a single excess, in which case the normalization, and ellipse orientation would likely be distorted by trying to fit this feature, producing ostensible deficits elsewhere). In light of this, I am left deeply skeptical of the authors' interpretations of these features.''

The concerns raised in the lengthy discussion which follows this comment in the report are addressed in the revised manuscript by presenting and discussing three different surface brightness models used for residual imaging. The three models vary in ellipticity and we discuss how each model changes the apparent residual ICM substructure. We also discuss the insignificant influence of the ICM excesses on the modeling and emphasize that an essential component in claiming the cavities and excesses are real structures is their one-to-one correlation with emission features across multiple wavebands. We have also incorporated two measures of the statistical robustness of the cavity detections into the text. We have chosen not to adopt the suggestion of the referee to perform MARX simulations since it introduces more uncertainties than addresses (e.g. accuracy of the input 2D surface brightness and temperature models).

========================

``Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept that the image is asymmetric, as suggested by Fig 1 (right panel; although the absence of a colour-scale for this image, and the use of smoothing, makes it hard to assess the formal statistical significance of the asymmetry).'' 

Discussion of the significance of each substructure has been added to the text, and color bars and labels now appear in the associated images.

========================

``Morphological disturbances are actually fairly commonplace in the centres of normal galaxy clusters (which, according to the authors, this is) due to, for example, ``cold fronts'', cavities (such as are postulated here), or (possibly) shocks. Since the nature of the asymmetries is essential for the results in this paper, the problem for the authors is to establish that the only viable explanation for the morphology of the gas is an excess in the east-west direction, and cavities perpendicular to it. Could the morphology be explained in terms of: only excess(es), only cavities, or possibly disturbances similar to cold fronts?  The question of cold fronts, in particular, is summarily dismissed by the authors in Section 4, where they argue that there is an absence of evidence of temperature or density discontinuities in the radial profiles, and in a 2D analysis. However: a) the 2D analysis is neither explained, nor the results of that analysis presented in this paper (hence the text discussing it should either be removed, or considerably expanded, and figures presented). b) the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Are the data also consistent with the asymmetries being (at least in part) due to cold fronts?''

We disagree that our charge is to establish that only excesses and cavities can reproduce the observed ICM morphology: there may be cold fronts or shocks, but the data does not allow us to make those claims. The analysis presented makes no assumptions about the underlying structure of the gas, and it is only after we have detected structure that the simplest physical explanation which is consistent with the data is presented, in this case cavities lying along the jets and associated excesses. Were we to claim, or even mention, that the morphology results from the presence of a cold front requires that we present detection of at least a temperature discontinuity, but this is only possible with a deeper dataset. Nonetheless, the referee is correct, a cold front (or shock) cannot be definitively ruled out, but incorporating discussion of undetected features for the sake of discussing them is unnecessary technical detail which detracts from the focus of the paper. Thus, mention of the 2D analysis has been dropped since it adds no value.

========================

``Next, even if we take at face value the residual plot shown in Fig 5, there remains the question of the statistical significance of the features which are shown. I appreciate that there is something of an industry of visually identifying and interpreting features in galaxy cluster images, without quantifying the formal statistical significance of those features.  This is, in my opinion, only acceptable insofar as the S/N is high enough for features to be unambiguously evident in minimally processed images, so that the computation of a formal significance is somewhat redundant. This is self-evidently not the case in this paper; the S/N appears low and the ``cavities'' are only visually identified by apparently stretching the colour-scale on a residual image. Coupled with the scientific importance of finding clear cavities in a system such as IRAS 09104+4109, an ``unambiguous'' detection demands a more thorough, quantitative analysis.  There are a number of ways this could be done, but I would suggest at minimum a Monte-Carlo analysis, in which realistic images are generated from a smooth, elliptical model, but with excesses similar to the purported features (but no cavities). These should be processed identically to the real data, and any spurious cavities assessed and characterized. Since the authors are using visual inspection to identify cavities, for this to be done objectively, a clear set of criteria will need to be adopted to explain what constitutes a cavity, and how its size and position are determined. A similar kind of analysis could be carried out to investigate the excess(es).''

Objectively determining the detectability of cavities is far beyond the scope of this paper and is a topic unto itself (see Birzan et al. 2009AIPC.1201..301B and their forthcoming paper). In the revised manuscript we have emphasized the coincidence of the cavities with the jets and have included significance measurements for the substructures.

========================

``The derived jet mechanical power is obtained from the properties of the cavities that are identified by the authors. However, the error-bars are determined entirely from the uncertainties on the spectroscopic properties of the ambient gas (eg pressure, sound speed), rather than the position and geometry of the cavities. I suspect this latter to be a major source of uncertainty, and so it will need to be folded in. Perhaps the authors could achieve this by Monte-Carlo simulations similar to those outlined above, in which cavities are added to the model before simulation, and the errors on the geometry and location are assessed. (This could also allow the authors to place limits on as yet undetected cavities, that could affect the jet power estimation).''

A systematic uncertainty of 10% is included in the volume estimates to account for unknown projection effects. Utilizing the suggested MARX Monte Carlo approach to assessing the volume uncertainties introduces more questions than it addresses. Given that the referee is skeptical of the cavity detections as they are, placing constraints on undetected cavities seems an unnecessary exercise.

========================

``The discussion of the analysis in this section was lacking in some necessary detail. How are the different regions chosen and characterized?  In particular, where are the background regions? Performing a background subtraction, such as described, makes sense only if the ``source'' region is expected to have the same spectrum as the ``background'', with an additional component added. If it is actually hot gas at a different temperature, what you would obtain by doing a subtraction is unclear. Since the authors already have background spectral models for everywhere on the CCD (used in Sect 4), why don't they employ these and fit the data in the source and background regions separately? This would considerably aid in interpreting these data, and assessing whether we're just dealing with temperature asymmetries. I'm assuming the fits shown in Table 3 are ``background subtracted''; which background was used for the ``EEx bgd''?''

A figure has been added showing the excess source and background regions and the text explains how they were chosen. Utilizing the deep backgrounds for spectral analysis does not address the nature of the excesses because cluster emission will not be removed.

========================

``The authors discuss some models as being a ``poor fit''. What does this mean; How was it assessed; How poor was the fit? Some models are apparently ``preferred'' over others; apparently Monte Carlo simulations were used to ascertain this, but these are not explained, nor the significance of the difference quantified. Additionally, what is the impact of varying the metallicity? Figures would be especially helpful here: The authors should overlay on Fig 6 (right panel) the best-fitting model without the additional Gaussian lines. They should also decompose their preferred model into its different components: the ICM component, and the Gaussian lines, and provide a comparison between this parameterization and the cloudy model they adopt.''

Plots of the spectra for each excess are not revealing because of the low-SN, and each of the numerous questions given above is now addressed in the text. The models are decomposed into their components as shown in Table 3. The validity of the base CLOUDY model can be found by comparing the values in Table 3, plots in Figure 6, and text in Section 6.2.

========================

``The ordering of the material was confusing. Section 3 uses results from Section 4; Section 6 uses results from Section 7. I could see no reason why these respective sections could not be re-ordered to aid with clarity.''

The structure of the paper has been extensively changed.

========================

``Section 3: I was very puzzled at this section, which seemed rather unconnected to anything else in the paper. I can understand the authors wishing to assess whether the cluster is ``ordinary'' by asking if it obeys standard scaling relations, and in that sense some of the material here is relevant. However, this is never done in this section; rather they compute the gravitating mass and gas mass within R200 by extrapolating fits within 0.2 R200 to the temperature and density profile, while the global parameters from the scaling relations are computed within R500!  They at no point explain why we should be interested in the tedious tabulation of various global parameters given in Table 1, and don't use them elsewhere in the paper. Therefore, it was unclear how this material led the authors to the conclusion ``RX J0913.7+4056 appears to be a typical massive, relaxed galaxy cluster."

The discussion has been expanded, R200 has been changed to R500, the table has been removed, and the section has been moved to the end of the paper. It is vital to demonstrate that the host cluster is rather normal and hence this discussion remains in the manuscript.

========================

``Section 4: The deprojection method for computing the gas density needs to be summarized, in addition to the citation to Cavagnolo 2009. Having read the description in Cavagnolo 2009, I am still puzzled as to how the emissivity is incorporated self-consistently into this calculation. Surely eta (r) is determined from the projected temperature/ abundance profiles, so doesn't this assume that the projected and deprojected temperature/ abundance profiles are identical? How do errors on the metallicity/ abundance profile propagate into eta, and hence onto the gas density profile? How are the errors on the gas density computed? The authors should provide details of how the Monte Carlo was performed.''

Discussion of the widely used Kriss et al. deprojection method is lengthy and hence remains only referenced. Answers to all the questions above are provided in the referred publication Cavagnolo et al. 2009 and references therein.

========================

``The quality of the fit to the entropy profile is not discussed. The best-fitting model should be overlaid on Fig 3. If the system is morphologically disturbed in the core, that means that the deprojection which is implicit in the derivation of the entropy is not going to be correct, and the gas entropy within, say, 30 kpc, will not be correctly derived. How much will this affect the fit presented in this section?''

The chi-squared and DOF are now noted in the text. Morphological disturbances are only relevant if gas over a broad range of entropy are co-spatial and thus averaged when we assume azimuthal symmetry. Again, these issues are discussed in-detail in the referred publication Cavagnolo et al. 2009 and references therein.
