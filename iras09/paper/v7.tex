\begin{abstract}
  Using a deep observation acquired with the \chandra\ X-ray
  Observatory (\cxo), we present a detailed study of the ultraluminous
  infrared brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) \inine\ (\irs, hereafter),
  and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM) of the galaxy cluster
  \rxj. The X-ray data reveals ICM cavities formed by $\sim 10^{44}
  ~\lum$ jets from the buried quasar (QSO) in \irs, and excess X-ray
  emission near the core which is well-modeled as illumination of the
  ICM and a galactic nebula by $\sim 10^{47}$ erg QSO
  radiation. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the X-ray
  properties of the \irs\ nucleus are dominated by reflected emission
  from a QSO embedded in a moderately Compton-thick medium. From these
  results, and those of prior studies, we suggest \irs\ may be a local
  example of how higher-redshift galaxies transition from a
  radiatively-dominated to a mechanically-dominated mode of feedback,
  and speculate that it may be related to evolution of black hole
  spin.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The discovery of tight correlations between properties of a galaxy and
the mass of its centrally located supermassive black hole (SMBH)
strongly indicate that the two co-evolve
\citep[\eg][]{1995ARA&A..33..581K, magorrian}. It has been suggested
that galaxy mergers and interactions, along with feedback from an
active galactic nucleus (AGN), form the foundation for SMBH-host
galaxy co-evolution \citep[\eg][]{2000MNRAS.311..576K}. Galaxy
formation models typically segregate AGN feedback into a distinct
early-time, radiatively-dominated quasar mode
\citep[\eg][]{2005Natur.435..629S} and a late-time,
mechanically-dominated radio mode \citep[\eg][]{croton06}. Early in
the galaxy formation process, characterized by the merger of gas-rich
galaxies and SMBH accretion rates of order Eddington, it is believed
that QSO radiation couples to gas fueling the AGN activity and drives
strong winds which deprive the SMBH of additional fuel
\citep[\eg][]{1998A&A...331L...1S}. This phase is expected to be
short-lived, resulting in the expulsion of large quantities of cold
gas from the host galaxy and temporarily quenching star formation
\citep[\eg][]{2006ApJ...642L.107N}. At later times, when the AGN
enters a phase of sub-Eddington accretion, prolonged and intermittent
mechanical heating of ambient gas by SMBH launched jets takes over the
regulation of galaxy growth \citep[see][for reviews]{cfreview,
  mcnamrev}.

Direct evidence of mechanical AGN feedback is seen in the form of
cavities and shocks found in the X-ray halos surrounding many massive
galaxies, particularly in the relatively dense ICM of galaxy clusters
\citep[\eg][]{perseus1, 2000ApJ...534L.135M}.  Encouragingly, these
cavities and shocks have been shown to contain enough energy to offset
much of the halo cooling \citep{perseus2, birzan04, dunn06,
  rafferty06, 2007ApJ...665.1057F}. Direct evidence of radiative AGN
feedback has been more elusive \citep[see][for a
  review]{2005ARA&A..43..769V}, with Mrk 231
\citep{2010arXiv1006.1655F} and low-redshift ellipticals
\citep{2009ApJ...690.1672S} providing the strongest evidence to date
that radiation pressure can drive gas out of the host galaxy. In a
unified feedback model, there may be a convergence of these modes
where an AGN cycles from radiative to mechanical dominance, however no
such examples have been found. This paper presents evidence that the
buried QSO in \irs\ is producing both mechanical and radiative
feedback, perhaps implying that it is a transition system and a local
example of how massive galaxies at higher redshifts evolve from
quasar-mode into radio-mode.

\irs\ is an uncommon, low-redshift ($z = 0.4418$) ultraluminous
infrared galaxy (ULIRG; $L_{\mathrm{IR}} > 10^{12} ~\lsol$). Unlike
most ULIRGs, \irs\ is the BCG in a rich galaxy cluster, but unlike
most BCGs, the spectral energy distribution of \irs\ is dominated by a
heavily obscured QSO: it has the optical spectrum of a Seyfert-2 with
99\% of the bolometric luminosity ($\sim 10^{47} ~\lum$) emerging
longward of 1 $\mu$m \citep[][see also Section
  \ref{sec:centsrc}]{1988ApJ...328..161K, 1993ApJ...415...82H,
  1994ApJ...436L..51F, 1998ApJ...506..205E, 2000A&A...353..910F,
  2001MNRAS.321L..15I}. Another interesting feature of \irs\ is the
nearly orthogonal misalignment between the beaming directions of the
radio jets and nuclear radiation \citep{1999ApJ...512..145H}. Using
X-ray data from the \cxo, we present the discovery of jet induced
cavities in the X-ray halo surrounding \irs, and an unambiguous
detection of QSO radiation interacting with cold gas in the galaxy
halo. The analysis and discussion that follows focuses primarily on
placing \irs\ into the quasar-mode/radio-mode AGN feedback paradigm,
and specifically on interpreting the misalignment between the
radiative and mechanical outflows using existing feedback models.

Data reduction is discussed in Section \ref{sec:obs}. Properties of
the ICM are analyzed in Sections \ref{sec:global} and
\ref{sec:rad}. Analysis of the ICM cavities, SMBH fueling, and QSO
irradiation of the ICM are given in Sections \ref{sec:cavs},
\ref{sec:fuel}, and \ref{sec:excess}, respectively. The complex
nuclear source is discussed in Section
\ref{sec:centsrc}. Interpretation of the results is given in Section
\ref{sec:evo}, with a brief summary in Section \ref{sec:summ}. \LCDM,
for which a redshift of $z = 0.4418$ corresponds to $\approx 9.1$ Gyr
for the age of the Universe, $\da \approx 5.72$ kpc arcsec$^{-1}$, and
$\dl \approx 2.45~\Gpc$.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction}
\label{sec:obs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{X-ray}
\label{sec:xray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Unless stated otherwise, all X-ray spectral analysis was performed
over the energy range 0.7--7.0 keV with the \chisq\ statistic in
\xspec\ 12.4 \citep{xspec} using an absorbed, single-temperature
\mekal\ model \citep{mekal1} with gas metal abundance as a free
parameter (\citealt{ag89} distribution) and quoted uncertainties of
90\% confidence. All spectral models had the Galactic absorbing column
density fixed at $\nhgal = 1.58 \times 10^{20} ~\pcmsq$
\citep{lab}. For the ICM, the assumed mean molecular weight is $\mu =
0.597$, with an adiabatic index $\gamma = 5/3$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\cxo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A 77.2 ks observation of \irs\ was taken in January 2009 with the
ACIS-I instrument (\dataset [ADS/Sa.CXO#Obs/10445] {ObsID 10445}; PI
Cavagnolo). The 9 ks archival ACIS-S \cxo\ observation from
November 1999 was included in the analysis (\dataset
[ADS/Sa.CXO#Obs/00509] {ObsID 509}; PI Fabian). Both datasets were
reprocessed and reduced using \ciao\ and \caldb\ versions 4.2. X-ray
events were selected using \asca\ grades, and corrections for the ACIS
gain change, charge transfer inefficiency, and degraded quantum
efficiency were applied. Point sources were located and excluded using
{\textsc{wavdetect}} and verified by visual inspection. Light curves
were extracted from a source-free region of each observation to look
for flares, and time intervals with $> 20\%$ of the mean background
count rate were excluded. After flare exclusion, the final combined
exposure time is 83 ks.

For imaging analysis, the flare-free events files were reprojected to
a common tangent point and summed. The astrometry of the ObsID 509
dataset was improved using a new aspect solution created with the
\ciao\ tool {\textsc{reproject\_aspect}} and the positions of several
field sources. After astrometry correction, the positional accuracy
between both observations improved by $\approx 0.4\arcs$ and was
comparable to the resolution limit of the ACIS detectors ($\approx
0.492\arcs$ pix$^{-1}$). We refer to the final point source free,
flare-free, exposure-corrected images as the ``clean'' images. The BCG
nucleus emits strong \feka\ emission which affects spectral fitting,
and for analysis of the ICM, the nucleus was excluded using a region
twice the size of the \cxo\ PSF 90\% EEF (see Section
\ref{sec:centsrc}). In Figure \ref{fig:imgs} are the 0.5--10.0 keV
mosaiced clean image of \rxj, a zoom-in of the core region harboring
\irs, and photons in the energy range 4.35--4.50 keV associated with
the \feka\ fluorescence line from the nucleus (discussed in Section
\ref{sec:centsrc}). Unless stated otherwise, the X-ray analysis in
this paper relates to \cxo\ data only.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\bepposax}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Conclusions reached in previous studies regarding the nature of the
\irs\ nuclear absorber have relied on the \bepposax\ hard X-ray
detection discussed by \citet{2000A&A...353..910F}. Here, we repeat
and confirm that analysis in order to compare our results in Section
\ref{sec:centsrc} against \citet{2000A&A...353..910F}. We retrieved
and re-analyzed the \bepposax\ data taken April 1998 (ObsCode
50273002; PI Franceschini). The data was reduced and analyzed with
\saxdas\ version 2.3.1 using the calibration data, cookbook, and epoch
appropriate response functions available from
HEASARC\footnote{http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/sax}.

Data from the PDS instrument (\esens\ = 15--300 keV) was accumulated,
screened for good time intervals, and then a light curve was
extracted. No significant variations of the light curve were
detected. A PDS total spectrum was extracted from the on-axis data,
and background subtraction was performed using the variable rise time
threshold. We measure a PDS 15--80 keV count rate of $0.106 \pm 0.055$
ct \ps. Fitting the PDS spectrum over the energy range 20--200 keV
with an absorbed power-law having fixed spectral index of $\Gamma =
1.7$ yielded fluxes of $f_{10 \dash 200} = 2.09^{+1.95}_{-1.95} \times
10^{-11} ~\flux$ and $f_{20 \dash 100} = 1.10^{+1.57}_{-1.63} \times
10^{-11} ~\flux$. The count rate and fluxes are consistent with the
results presented in \citet{2000A&A...353..910F}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{\integral\ and \swift}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\irs\ was not detected in the \integral\ IBIS Extragalactic AGN Survey
\citep[][\esens\ = 20--100 keV]{2006ApJ...636L..65B}. Our re-analysis
of archival \integral\ ISGRI and JEM-X data resulted in $3\sigma$
upper limits between 10--35 keV and 20--100 keV of $f_{10 \dash 35} =
1.28 \times 10^{-12} ~\flux$ and $f_{20 \dash 100} = 5.70 \times
10^{-11} ~\flux$, narrowly higher than the \bepposax\ 20--100 keV PDS
measured flux, and consistent with the IBIS Survey non-detection for a
$z = 0.44$ source. \irs\ was also not detected in the 22 month
\swift-BAT Survey \citep[][\esens\ = 15--150
  keV]{2010ApJS..186..378T}. The \swift-BAT Survey has a 14--195 keV
$4.8\sigma$ detection limit of $2.2 \times 10^{-11} ~\flux$, 14\%
higher than the 14--195 keV \irs\ flux expected based on the
\bepposax\ detection, and consistent with the \integral\ upper
limits. Assuming the upper limits are representative of an $\approx
1\mydeg$ region around \irs\ (\ie\ the full-width half maximum PDS
field of view), the lack of detected hard X-ray sources near
\irs\ suggests that the PDS detection did not originate from a
brighter off-axis source, assuming the source is not transient or was
a one-time event.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Radio}
\label{sec:radio}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Between 1986 and 2000, \irs\ was observed with VLA at multiple radio
frequencies and resolutions \citep[see also][for 1.4 and 5 GHz
  analysis; hereafter H93]{1993ApJ...415...82H}. Continuum mode
observations were taken from the VLA archive and reduced using version
3.0 of the Common Astronomy Software Applications (\casa). Flagging of
bad data was performed using a combination of \casa's
{\textsc{flagdata}} tool in {\textsc{rfi}} mode and manual
inspection. Radio images were generated by Fourier transforming,
cleaning, self-calibrating, and restoring individual radio
observations. The additional steps of phase and amplitude
self-calibration were included to increase the dynamic range and
sensitivity of the radio maps. All sources within the primary beam and
first side-lobe detected with fluxes $> 5\sigma_{\mathrm{rms}}$ were
imaged to further maximize the sensitivity of the radio maps.

Resolved radio emission associated with \irs\ is detected at 1.4 GHz,
5.0 GHz, and 8.4 GHz, while a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $0.84$ mJy is
established at 14.9 GHz. Fluxes for unresolved emission at 74 MHz, 151
MHz, and 325 MHz were retrieved from VLSS \citep{vlss}, 7C Survey
\citep{1999MNRAS.306...31R}, and WENSS \citep{1997A&AS..124..259R},
respectively. No formal detection is found in VLSS, however, an
overdensity of emission at the location of \irs\ is evident. For
completeness, we measured a flux for the potential source, but
excluded the value during fitting of the radio spectrum.

The combined 1.4 GHz image is the deepest and reveals the most
extended structure, thus our discussion regarding radio morphology is
guided using this frequency. The deconvolved, integrated 1.4 GHz flux
of the continuous extended structure coincident with \irs, and having
$S_{\nu} \ga 3\sigma_{\mathrm{rms}}$, is $14.0 \pm 0.51$ mJy. A
significant spur of radio emission extending northeast from the
nucleus is detected with flux $0.21 \pm 0.07$ mJy. Radio contours were
generated beginning at 3 times the rms noise and moving up in 6
log-space steps to the peak intensity of 4.7 mJy beam$^{-1}$. These
are the contours referenced in all following discussion of the radio
source morphology and its interaction with the X-ray gas.

Below we determine properties of the radio source for the purpose of
constraining properties of the jets which created cavities in the
\rxj\ X-ray halo (see Section \ref{sec:cavs}). The radio spectrum was
fitted between 151 MHz and 8.4 GHz for the full radio source (lobes,
jets, and core) with the well-known KP \citep{1962SvA.....6..317K,
  pach}, JP \citep{1973A&A....26..423J}, and CI
\citep{1987MNRAS.225..335H} synchrotron models. The models primarily
vary in their assumptions regarding the electron pitch-angle
distribution and number of injections. The models were fitted to the
radio spectrum using the code of \citet{2005ApJ...624..656W}, which is
based on the method of \citet{1991ApJ...383..554C}. The JP model
(single electron injection, randomized but isotropic pitch-angle
distribution) yields the best fit with \chisq(DOF)$ = 4.91(3)$, a
break frequency of $\nu_B = 12.9 \pm 1.0$ GHz, and a low-frequency
($\nu < 2$ GHz) spectral index of $\alpha = -1.10 \pm 0.09$. The
bolometric radio luminosity was approximated by integrating under the
JP curve between $\nu_1 = 10$ MHz and $\nu_2 =$ 10,000 MHz, giving
$\lrad = 1.09 \times 10^{42}~\lum$. The radio spectrum and best-fit
models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:radio}.

Assuming inverse-Compton (IC) scattering and synchrotron emission are
the dominant radiative mechanisms of the radio source, the time since
acceleration for an isotropic particle population is given by
\citet{2001AJ....122.1172S} as
\begin{equation}
  \tsync = 1590 \left(\frac{B^{1/2}}{B^2 + B_{\mathrm{CMB}}^2}\right)~
  \left[\nu_{\mathrm{B}} (1+z)\right]^{-1/2} ~\Myr
\end{equation}
where $B$ [\mg] is magnetic field strength, $B_{\mathrm{CMB}} =
3.25(1+z)^2$ [\mg] is a correction for IC losses to the cosmic
microwave background, $\nu_{\mathrm{B}}$ [GHz] is the radio spectrum
break frequency, and $z$ is the dimensionless source redshift. Note
that this form for \tsync\ neglects energy lost to adiabatic expansion
of the radio plasma \citep{1968ARA&A...6..321S}. We assume that $B$ is
not significantly different from the equipartition magnetic field
strength, $B_{\mathrm{eq}}$ \citep[see][for thorough discussion of the
  validity and shortcomings of this assumption]{birzan08}, which is
derived from the minimum energy density condition as
\citep{1980ARA&A..18..165M}
\begin{equation}
  B_{\mathrm{eq}} = \left[\frac{6 \pi ~c_{12}(\alpha,\nu_1, \nu_2)
      ~\lrad ~(1+k)}{V \Phi}\right]^{2/7} ~\mathrm{\mg}
\end{equation}
where $c_{12}(\alpha,\nu_1,\nu_2)$ is a dimensionless constant
\citep{pach}, \lrad\ [$\lum$] is the integrated radio luminosity from
$\nu_1$ to $\nu_2$, $k$ is the dimensionless ratio of lobe energy in
non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons, $V$ [\cc]
is the radio source volume, and $\Phi$ is a dimensionless radiating
population volume filling factor. Synchrotron age as a function of $k$
and $\Phi$ for the full radio source is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:radio}. For various combinations of $k$ and $\Phi$,
$B_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4 \dash 57 ~\mg$, with associated synchrotron
ages in the range $\approx 1 \dash 12$ Myr, typical of other BCG radio
sources \citep[\eg][]{birzan08}. Repeating the above analysis using
only radio lobe emission at 1.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz, and an 8.4 GHz upper
limit, reveals \tsync\ could be as high as $30$ Myr as a result of a
significantly steeper spectral index and lower break frequency.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Global ICM Properties}
\label{sec:global}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our analysis begins at the cluster scale with the integrated
properties of the \rxj\ ICM hosting \irs. We define the mean cluster
temperature, \cltx, as the ICM temperature within a core-excised
aperture extending to $R_{\Delta_c}$, the radius at which the average
cluster density is $\Delta_c$ times the critical density for a
spatially flat Universe. We chose $\Delta_c = 500$ and used the
relations from \cite{2002A&A...389....1A} to calculate
$R_{\Delta_c}$. \rxj\ has a luminous, cool core and complex nucleus
which are not representative of \cltx, thus, the convention of
\citet{2007ApJ...668..772M} was followed and emission inside $0.15
~\rf$ was excised. Source spectra were extracted from the region $0.15
\dash 1.0~\rf$ and background spectra were extracted from reprocessed
\caldb\ blank-sky backgrounds (see Section \ref{sec:rad}). Because
\cltx\ and $R_{\Delta_c}$ are correlated in the adopted definitions,
they were recursively determined until three consecutive iterations
produced \cltx\ values which agreed within the 68\% confidence
intervals. We measure $\cltx = 7.54^{+1.76}_{-1.15}$ keV corresponding
to $\rf = 1.16^{+0.27}_{-0.19}~\Mpc$. Measurements for other
$R_{\Delta_c}$ apertures are given in Table \ref{tab:specfits}.

The cluster gas and gravitational masses were derived using the
deprojected radial electron density and temperature profiles presented
in Section \ref{sec:rad}. Electron gas density, $\nelec$, was
converted to total gas density as $n_g = 1.92 \nelec \mu \mH$ where
\mH\ [g] is the mass of hydrogen. The gas density profile was fitted
with a $\beta$-model \citep{betamodel}, and the temperature profile
was fitted with the 3D-$T(r)$ model of \citet{2006ApJ...640..691V} to
ensure continuity and smoothness of the radial log-space derivatives
when solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. Total gas mass was
calculated by assuming spherical symmetry and integrating the best-fit
$\beta$-model out to \rt, giving $\mgas(r<\rt) = 7.99 ~(\pm 0.65)
\times 10^{13} ~\msol$. The gravitating mass was derived by solving
the hydrostatic equilibrium equation using the analytic density and
temperature profiles. We calculate $\mgrav(r<\rt) = 7.22 ~(\pm 1.44)
\times 10^{14} ~\msol$, giving a ratio of gas mass to gravitating mass
of $0.11 \pm 0.02$. The gas and gravitating mass errors were estimated
from 10,000 Monte Carlo realizations of the measured density and
temperature profiles and their associated uncertainties. Because the
radial temperature and density profiles extend to $\approx 0.2 \rt$,
the mass calculations include significant extrapolation, and thus may
be upper limits, though the ratios should not be affected.

\rxj\ is a hot, massive cluster with a temperature, luminosity, and
gas fraction consistent with flux-limited and representative cluster
samples \citep{hiflugcs2, 2009A&A...498..361P}. With the exception of
the strange BCG at its heart, \rxj\ appears to be a typical massive,
relaxed galaxy cluster. The integrated X-ray cluster properties, and
the lack of a detected radio halo, suggest the system has not
undergone a recent major merger or cluster-scale AGN outburst which
may have dramatically disrupted the ICM. Adjusted for differences in
assumed cosmology, our global measurements agree with prior studies of
\irs\ \citep[\eg][]{2000MNRAS.315..269A}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Radial ICM Properties}
\label{sec:rad}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now we discuss the finer global structure of \rxj\ via radial ICM
properties. Consistent with the analysis of Section \ref{sec:global},
the BCG nucleus was excluded from all radial analysis. Temperature
(\tx) and abundance ($Z$) profiles were created using circular annuli
centered on the cluster X-ray peak and containing 2500 and 5000 source
counts per annulus, respectively. A deprojected temperature profile
was generated using the \textsc{deproj} method in \xspec. We use the
projected profile in all analysis as it does not significantly differ
from the deprojected profile. Spectra were grouped to 25 source counts
per energy channel. \caldb\ blank-sky backgrounds were reprocessed and
reprojected to match each observation, and then normalized for
variations of the hard-particle background using the ratio of
blank-sky and observation 9.5--12 keV count rates. Following the
method outlined in \citet{2005ApJ...628..655V}, a fixed background
component was included during spectral analysis to account for the
spatially-varying Galactic foreground \citep[see][for more
  detail]{xrayband}. The temperature and abundance profiles are shown
in the top row of Figure \ref{fig:gallery}. After masking out all
X-ray substructure (see Section \ref{sec:excess}) and the central
$2\arcs$, a grouped spectrum for the central 20 kpc was fitted with a
thermal model plus a cooling flow component. The best-fit model had a
mass deposition rate of $\mdot = 206^{+87}_{-65} ~\msol$ for upper and
lower temperatures of 5.43 keV and 0.65 keV, respectively, with
abundance $0.5 ~\Zsol$. The factor of 3 temperature difference implies
there may be interesting soft X-ray ionization lines, but currently
there is no grating X-ray spectroscopy of \irs.

A surface brightness (SB) profile was extracted using concentric
$1\arcs$ wide circular annuli centered on the cluster X-ray peak. From
the SB and temperature profiles, a deprojected electron density
(\nelec) profile was derived using the \citet{kriss83} technique
\citep[see][for more detail]{accept}. Errors for the density profile
were estimated from 10,000 Monte Carlo bootstrap resamplings of the SB
profile. The SB and electron gas density profiles are shown in the
second row of Figure \ref{fig:gallery}.

Total gas pressure ($P = n \tx$), entropy ($K = \tx\nelec^{-2/3}$),
cooling time ($\tcool = 3n\tx~[2\nelec \nH \Lambda(T,Z)]^{-1}$), and
enclosed X-ray luminosity (\lx) profiles were also created, where $n =
2.3 \nH$ and $\nH \approx \nelec/1.2$. These profiles are presented in
the bottom two rows of Figure \ref{fig:gallery}. Uncertainties for
each profile were calculated by propagating the individual parameter
errors and then summing in quadrature. The cooling functions,
$\Lambda(T,Z)$, used to calculate cooling times were derived from the
best-fit spectral model for each annulus of the temperature profile
and linearly interpolated onto the grid of the higher resolution
density profile. The function $K(r) = \kna +\khun (r/100
~\kpc)^{\alpha}$ was fitted to the entropy profile, giving best-fit
values of $\kna = 12.6 \pm 2.9 ~\ent$, $\khun = 139 \pm 8 ~\ent$, and
$\alpha = 1.71 \pm 0.10$.

The \rxj\ ICM structure is typical of the cool core class of galaxy
clusters, with a temperature profile that rises with increasing radius
and an entropy profile with a relatively small, flattened core. There
are no resolved discontinuities in the \tx, \nelec, or $P$ profiles to
suggest the presence of a shock or cold front. Additional 2D analysis
using the weighted Voronoi tessellation and contour binning methods of
\citet{wvt} and \citet{2006MNRAS.371..829S}, respectively, also did
not reveal any significant temperature or abundance substructure. The
entropy profile is similar to other cool core clusters \citep{accept},
and with the population of $\kna < 30 ~\ent$ clusters that have
radio-loud AGN and star formation in the BCG \citep{haradent,
  rafferty08}. The $\kna \la 30 ~\ent$ scale defines an entropy regime
in which thermal electron conduction in cluster cores is too
inefficient to suppress widespread environmental cooling
\citep{conduction}. Therefore, cooling subsystems, like gas ram
pressure stripped from cluster members or ICM thermal instabilities,
should be long-lived. There is an abundance of cool, gaseous
substructure surrounding \irs, and in Section \ref{sec:excess} we
discuss the relation of this structure to the AGN.

\section{ICM Cavity System}
\label{sec:cavs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To aid investigation of ICM substructure, a residual X-ray image was
created by subtracting a SB model for the ICM from the \cxo\ clean
image. The \cxo\ clean image was binned by a factor of 2 and the
SB isophotes were fitted using the \iraf\ tool \textsc{ellipse}. The
geometric parameters ellipticity ($\epsilon$), position angle
($\phi$), and centroid ($C$) were initially free to vary, but the
best-fit values for each isophote converged to mean values of
$\epsilon = 0.14$, $\phi = -76\mydeg$, and $C$ [J2000] = (09:13:45.5;
+40:56:28.4). These values were fixed in the fitting routine to
eliminate the isophotal twisting resulting from statistical variation
of the best-fit values for each radial step. The SB model was
subtracted from the clean image, resulting in the residual image shown
in Figure \ref{fig:resid}.

The faint SB decrements NW and SE of the nucleus in the clean image
are resolved into cylindrical voids in the residual image. The void
and radio jet morphologies closely trace each other, confirming they
share a common origin in the AGN outburst. Cavities are a well-known
phenomenon, but currently, \irs\ is the highest redshift object where
cavities have been directly imaged. In addition, \irs\ is thus far the
only example of a QSO-dominated system with an unambiguous cavity
detection. Using a 1994 \rosat\ HRI observation,
\citet{1995MNRAS.274L..63F} found a ``hole'' in the core of
\rxj\ which they attributed to absorption by a $> 1000 ~\msolpy$
cooling flow. Neither the cavities nor the hole are seen in a longer
1995 HRI follow-up observation, and when juxtaposed with the
\cxo\ residual image, the hole is not associated with the
cavities.

The AGN outburst energetics were investigated using properties of the
cavities \citep[see][for a review]{mcnamrev}. Cavity volumes, $V$,
were calculated by approximating each void in the X-ray image with a
right circular cylinder projected onto the plane of the sky along the
cylinder radial axis. The lengthwise axis of the cylinders were
assumed to lie in a plane perpendicular to the line of sight that
passes through the central AGN. The energy in each cavity, $\ecav =
\gamma PV/(\gamma-1)$, was estimated by assuming the contents are a
relativistic plasma ($\gamma = 4/3$), and then integrating the total
gas pressure, $P$, over the surface of each cylinder. The radio source
morphology, spectrum, and age suggest the jets were recently being fed
by the central AGN. Thus, we assumed the cavities were created on a
timescale dictated by the ambient gas sound speed,
\tsonic\ \citep[see][]{birzan04}, and the distance the AGN outflow has
traveled to create each cavity was set to the cylinder length, not the
midpoints, as is common. The power of each cavity is thus $\pcav =
\ecav/\tsonic$. Cavity power is often assumed to be a good estimate of
the physical quantity jet power, \pjet, but note that neither accounts
for energy which may be imparted to shocks. Properties of the
individual cavities are listed in Table \ref{tab:cylcavities}.

The total cavity energy and power are estimated at $\ecav = 5.11 ~(\pm
1.33) \times 10^{59}$ erg and $\pcav = 3.05 ~(\pm 1.03) \times 10^{44}
~\lum$, respectively. Radio power has been shown to be a reasonable
surrogate for estimating mean jet power \citep{birzan08}. Thus, we
checked the \pcav\ calculation using the \citet{pjet} \pjet-\prad\ 1.4
GHz and 200--400 MHz scaling relations. The relations give $\pjet
\approx 2 \dash 6 \times 10^{44} ~\lum$, in agreement with the X-ray
measurements. Compared with other systems hosting cavities,
\irs\ resides between the middle and upper-end of the cavity power
distribution. The AGN outburst is powerful, but there is nothing
unusual about the energetics or the radiative efficiency (\prad/\pjet)
given the cluster mass and ICM properties.

Of interest is how the AGN energetics compare to the cooling rate of
the host X-ray halo. The cooling radius was set at the radius where
the ICM cooling time is equal to $H_0^{-1}$ at the redshift of
\irs. We calculate $R_{\mathrm{cool}} = 128$ kpc, and measure an
unabsorbed bolometric luminosity within this radius of
$L_{\mathrm{cool}} = 1.61^{+0.25}_{-0.20} \times 10^{45} ~\lum$. If
all of the cavity energy is thermalized over $4\pi$ sr, then $\approx
20\%$ of the energy radiated away by gas within $R_{\mathrm{cool}}$ is
replaced by energy in the observed AGN outflow. Assuming the mean ICM
cooling rate does not vary significantly on a timescale of $\sim 1$
Gyr, this highly optimistic scenario implies that 5 similar power AGN
outbursts will significantly suppress cooling of the cluster halo.

The \pcav\ estimates neglect the influence of shocks, but the
synchrotron age and cavity age are useful in addressing this issue. If
\tsync\ is an accurate measure of the radio source age, then the age
discrepency $\tsonic \ga 42$ Myr versus $\tsync \la 30$ Myr implies
the AGN outflow is supersonic, otherwise the radio-loud plasma will
radiate away all its energy and be radio-silent prior to reaching the
end of the observed jet. The implication being that some amount of
energy may have gone into gas shocking. Recall, however, that no
shocks are detected in the X-ray analysis, and note that the
properties of \irs\ optical emission-line nebulae are inconsistent
with excitation due to shocks \citep{1996MNRAS.283.1003C,
  2000AJ....120..562T}. But, the nebular regions studied are $\ga 20$
kpc from the jet axis, and may not be indicative of gas dynamics close
to the outflow. Regardless, the energy in possible shocks was crudely
estimated by setting $t_{\mathrm{sonic}} = 30$ Myr and adjusting
\pcav\ by the Mach number: $\Delta \pcav = \Delta P / \Delta t$ and
$\Delta P \propto M^3$. Relative to the ICM sound speed, the velocity
needed to reach the end of the radio jet in 30 Myrs requires a Mach
number of $\approx 1.7$, which brings the outburst power up to
$\approx 3 \times 10^{45} ~\lum$ ($\ecav \approx 2 \times 10^{60}$ erg
for a 30 Myr duration). Within the formal uncertainties, the AGN
outburst power is on the order of a few times $10^{44} ~\lum$, with
the possibility of being as large as $10^{45} ~\lum$.

\section{Fueling the AGN Outburst}
\label{sec:fuel}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some of the gravitational binding energy of the material accreting
onto the SMBH is transported outward via relativistic jets. Assuming
this conversion has an efficiency $\epsilon$, the energy deposited in
cavities by the jets implies an accretion mass expressed as $\macc =
\ecav/(\epsilon c^2)$ with a time-averaged mass accretion rate of
$\dmacc = \macc/t_{\mathrm{sonic}}$. Setting $\epsilon = 0.1$, the AGN
outburst resulted from the accretion of $2.86 ~(\pm 0.75) \times
10^{6} ~\msol$ of matter at a rate of $0.054 \pm 0.004 ~\msolpy$. If
the accretion flow feeding the SMBH is spherically symmetric, it can
be characterized in terms of the Eddington (Eqn. \ref{eqn:edd}) and
Bondi (Eqn. \ref{eqn:bon}) accretion rates,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dmedd &=& \frac{2.2}{\epsilon} \left(\frac{\mbh}{10^9~\msol}\right)
  ~\msolpy  \label{eqn:edd}\\
  \dmbon &=& 0.013 ~K_{\mathrm{Bon}}^{-3/2} \left(\frac{\mbh}{10^9
    ~\msol}\right)^{2} ~\msolpy \label{eqn:bon}
\end{eqnarray}
where $K_{\mathrm{Bon}}$ [\ent] is the mean entropy of gas within the
Bondi radius and \mbh\ [\msol] is black hole mass. The Eddington rate
defines the maximal inflow rate of gas not expelled by radiation
pressure, as where the Bondi rate represents the idealized spherical
accretion of gas onto a compact object at the ambient sound speed. The
\citet{2007MNRAS.379..711G} relations relating absolute $[B,R,K]$-band
magnitudes to \mbh\ predict $\mbh = 0.5 \dash 5.0 \times 10^9 ~\msol$,
and we adopt a weighted mean value $1.05 ~(\pm 0.17) \times 10^9
~\msol$ ($[B,R,K]$-band magnitudes were taken from HyperLeda, SDSS,
and 2MASS, respectively). Assuming $K_{\mathrm{Bon}} = \kna$, then
$\dmedd \approx 23 ~\msolpy$ and $\dmbon \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-4}
~\msolpy$. Thus, the Eddington and Bondi ratios for the accretion
event which powered the AGN outburst are $\dmacc/\dmedd \approx 0.002$
and $\dmacc/\dmbon \approx 300$. Since the nucleus hosts a QSO, the
highly sub-Eddington \dmacc\ places no additional strain on the
accretion process, but the Bondi ratio is atypically large, implying
highly efficient accretion of hot gas.

The Bondi radius for \irs\ is unresolved ($\rbon = 9$ pc), and
$K_{\mathrm{Bon}}$ is likely less than \kna. But, for a Bondi ratio of
at least unity, $K_{\mathrm{Bon}}$ must be $\la 0.4 ~\ent$, lower than
is measured for even galactic coronae \citep{coronae}. In terms of
entropy, $\tcool \propto K^{3/2} ~\tx^{-1}$ \citep{d06}. Assuming gas
close to \rbon\ is no cooler than 0.65 keV, the accreting material
will have $\tcool \la 6$ Myr, a factor of $\sim 100$ below the
shortest ICM cooling time and 1/5 the free-fall (ff) time in the
core. But this creates the problem that the gas should fragment and
form stars (since $\tcool < t_{\rm{ff}}$), and that gas close to
\rbon\ is disconnected from cooling at larger radii, breaking the
feedback loop \citep{2006NewA...12...38S}. If instead cold-mode
accretion dominates, then the gas which becomes fuel for the AGN is
distributed in the BCG halo and falls into the BCG as a result of
cooling \citep{pizzolato05, 2010arXiv1003.4181P}. Indeed, radial
filaments and gaseous substructure within 30 kpc of \irs\ are seen
down to the resolution-limit of
\hst\ \citep{1999Ap&SS.266..113A}. This may indicate the presence of
cooling, overdense regions similar to the cold blobs expected in
cold-mode accretion. Though Bondi accretion cannot be ruled out, it
does not seem viable, and the process of cold-mode accretion appears
to be more consistent with the nature of \irs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{QSO Irradiation of the ICM}
\label{sec:excess}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Figure \ref{fig:resid}, three regions of X-ray emission in excess
of the best-fit SB model are highlighted. The regions are illustrative
and approximate the constant SB contours used to define the spectral
extraction regions. Each region is denoted by its location relative to
the nucleus: northern excess (NEx), eastern excess (EEx), and western
excess (WEx). The NEx and WEx appear to be part of a tenuous, arc-like
filament which may be gas displaced by the NW radio jet. In other
clusters, structures similar to the NEx-WEx are found to be cool rims
of gas \citep[\eg][]{2009ApJ...697L..95B}, but the \cxo\ data are
insufficient to determine if these structures form a continuous
filament in \irs, hence we treat the NEx and WEx as separate.

Spectral analysis was performed on each region. A background spectrum
was extracted from regions neighboring the excesses which did not show
enhanced emission in the residual image. The backgrounds were scaled
to correct for differences in sky area. For each region, the ungrouped
source and background spectra were differenced within \xspec\ and fit
with \xspec's modified Cash statistic \citep{1979ApJ...228..939C},
appropriate for low-count \citep{1989ApJ...342.1207N,
  2007A&A...462..429B}, background-subtracted spectra \citep[see
  \xspec\ Manual Appendix B and][]{2004A&A...423...75V,
  2007ApJ...666..835B, 2009A&A...503...35E}. The low signal-to-noise
ratio (SN) of each spectrum precluded setting metal abundance as a
free parameter when fitting a thermal model. Since the three excesses
reside within the two central annuli of the abundance profile, the
abundance was fixed at $0.5 ~\Zsol$. The best-fit values for the
spectral models are given in Table \ref{tab:excess}.

The analysis of the NEx spectrum was inconclusive due to low signal to
noise: unconstrained thermal and power-law models had best-fit $\tx
\sim 7$ keV and $\Gamma \sim 1.9$, respectively. The northern radio
jet terminates in the NEx region, and the hardness ratio map (see
Section \ref{sec:centsrc} and Figure \ref{fig:resid}) shows a possible
hot spot in this same area. The NEx may result from non-thermal
emission in the hot spot, but we cannot confirm this hypothesis
spectroscopically.

The WEx has a residual spectrum consistent with thermal emission, but
the EEx spectrum has prominent features at $E < 2$ keV which were
poorly fit by a single-component thermal model. The EEx thermal
\feka\ complex was also poorly fit because of an obvious asymmetry
toward lower energies. To reconcile the poor fit, three Gaussians were
added to the EEx model. Comparison of goodness of fits determined from
10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the best-fit spectra suggest the
model with the Gaussians is preferred. The strength of the features
relative to the continuum suggest a thermal origin is unlikely, and
that the features may be emission line blends. Below we discuss the
EEx exclusively.

H93 and \citet[][hereafter H99]{1999ApJ...512..145H} suggest the AGN
which produced the large-scale jets has been reoriented within the
last few Myrs, resulting in a new beaming direction close to the line
of sight and at roughly a right angle to the previous beaming
axis. Interestingly, the new AGN axis suggested by H99 is coincident
with the EEx, the radio spur northeast of the radio core, a cone of UV
ionization, an ionized optical nebula, and highly polarized diffuse
optical emission. These respective features are outlined in Figure
\ref{fig:resid}. \citet{2010MNRAS.402.1561R} demonstrate that the QSO
in H1821+643, which is 2 times more luminous than \irs, is capable of
photoionizing gas up to 30 kpc from the nucleus, and we suspect a
similar process may be occurring in \irs.

To test this hypothesis, reflection and diffuse spectra were simulated
for the nebula and ICM coincident with the EEx using
\cloudy\ \citep{cloudy}. The nebular gas density and ionization state
were taken from \citet{2000AJ....120..562T}, while the initial ICM
temperature, density, and abundance were set at 3 keV, 0.04 \pcc, and
0.5 \Zsol, respectively. No Ca or Fe lines are detected from the
nebula coincident with the EEx, possibly as a result of metal
depletion onto dust grains \citep[\eg][]{1993ApJ...414L..17D}, while
strong Mg, Ne, and O lines are \citep{2000AJ....120..562T}. Thus, a
metal depleted, grain-rich, 12 kpc thick nebular slab was placed 15
kpc from an attenuated $\Gamma = 1.7$ power law source with power $1
\times 10^{47} ~\lum$. Likewise, a $17 ~\kpc \times 16 ~\kpc$ ICM slab
was placed 19 kpc from the same source. The QSO radiation was
attenuated using a 15 kpc column of density 0.06 \pcc, abundance 0.5
\Zsol, and temperature 3 keV. The output models were summed, folded
through the \cxo\ responses using \xspec, and fitted to the observed
EEx spectrum (shown in Figure \ref{fig:qso}).

In the energy range 0.1--10.0 keV, the nebula emission lines which
exceed the thermal line emission originate from Si, Cl, O, F, K, Ne,
Co, Na, and Fe and occur as blends around redshifted 0.4, 0.6, 0.9,
and 1.6 keV. The energies and strengths of these blends are in good
agreement with the EEx spectrum. Further, the \feka\ emission from the
nebula is 100 times fainter than that from the ICM, and the observed
asymmetry of the EEx \feka\ emission results from the 6.4 keV
\feka\ photoionized line of the ICM. It is clear that beamed QSO
radiation is responsible for the nature of the EEx, but if the
photoionization equates to heating of the gas is unclear.

One alternative explanation for the EEx is that it is low entropy gas
uplifted from deeper within the core along the new AGN beaming
axis. Scattered UV emission 32 kpc from the core places a minimum
lifetime of 73 kyr for the new beaming direction (H93), and, assuming
saturated heat flux across the EEx surface, the evaporation time is
exceedingly short, $< 1$ Myr. These short timescales suggest the EEx
was transported to the present location at $> 20$ times the ambient
sound speed, or $v \sim 0.06 \dash 0.1c$, well below typical jet bulk
flow velocities. The radio spur has a 1.4 GHz luminosity of $\approx 3
\times 10^{39} ~\lum$, suggesting an associated 1 Myr old jet would
have $\sim 10^{57}$ erg of kinetic energy, which is sufficient to lift
$\sim 10^{9} ~\msol$ to a distance of 19 kpc. It appears uplift is
feasible, particularly if the gas is magnetically-shielded and
conduction is staved-off.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Nucleus X-ray Emission}
\label{sec:centsrc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The centroid and extent of the nuclear X-ray source were determined
using the \ciao\ tool {\tt wavdetect} and the \cxo\ PSF. Each was
confirmed with a hardness ratio map calculated as $HR = f(2.0 \dash
9.0 ~\keV) / f(0.5 \dash 2.0 ~\keV)$, where $f$ is the flux in the
denoted energy band. A source extraction region was defined using the
90\% enclosed energy fraction (EEF) of the normalized \cxo\ PSF
specific to the nuclear source median photon energy and off-axis
position. The elliptical source region had an effective radius of
$1.16\arcs$. A segmented elliptical annulus with the same central
coordinates, ellipticity, and position angle as the source region, but
having 5 times the area, was used for the background region. The
background annulus was broken into segments to avoid the regions of
excess X-ray emission discussed in Section \ref{sec:excess}. The $HR$
map and extraction regions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nucleus}.

Source and background spectra were created using the \ciao\ tool {\tt
  psextract}. The source spectrum was grouped to have 20 counts per
energy channel. The background-subtracted \cxo\ spectra and best-fit
models are presented in Figure \ref{fig:nucleus}. The significant flux
difference below 1.3 keV is a result of the greater effective area of
the ACIS-S3 CCD in 1999 versus ACIS-I3 in 2009. Approximately 72\% of
the 2009 spectrum (hereafter, SP09) is from the source, with a count
rate of $1.63 ~(\pm 0.06) \times 10^{-2}$ ct \ps\ in the 0.5-9.0 keV
band. For the 1999 spectrum (hereafter, SP99), 67\% is source flux,
with a 0.5--9.0 keV count rate of $2.71 ~(\pm 0.26) \times 10^{-2}$ ct
\ps. We confirm the findings of \citet{2001MNRAS.321L..15I} that the
ICM thermal \feka\ contribution to the nuclear spectrum is negligible,
and that prominent, line-like features around 0.8 keV and 1.3 keV are
superposed on the continuum.

Previous studies have shown the nuclear spectrum is best modeled as
Compton reflection from cold matter with a strong \feka\ fluorescence
line ($E_{\rm{rest}} = 6.4$ keV). The SP99 and SP09 were fitted
separately in \xspec\ over the energy range 0.5--7.0 keV with an
absorbed \pexrav\ model \citep{pexrav} plus three Gaussians. The
disk-reflection geometry employed in the \pexrav\ model is not ideal
for fitting reflection from a Compton-thick torus
\citep{2009MNRAS.397.1549M}, but no other suitable \xspec\ model is
currently available. Hence, only the \pexrav\ reflection component was
fitted and no high energy cut-off for the power law was used. Fitting
separate SP99 and SP09 models allowed for source variation in the
decade between observations, however $\Gamma$ was poorly constrained
for SP99 and thus fixed at the SP09 value. Using constraints from
\citet{2000AJ....120..562T}, the model parameters for reflector
abundance and source inclination were fixed at $1.0 ~\Zsol$ and $i =
50\mydeg$, respectively. Setting abundance as a free parameter did not
statistically improve the fits. The best-fit model parameters are
presented in Table \ref{tab:nucspec}.

Using a solar abundance thermal component in place of the two
low-energy Gaussians yielded a statistically worse fit. The model
systematically underestimated the 1--1.5 keV flux and overestimated
the 2--4 keV flux. Leaving the thermal component abundance as a free
parameter resulted in $0.1 ~\Zsol$, \ie\ the thermal component tended
toward a featureless skewed-Gaussian. Strong Mg, Ne, S, and Si
K$\alpha$ fluorescence lines at $E < 3.0$ keV can be present in
reflection spectra \citep{1991MNRAS.249..352G}, as can Fe L-shell
lines from photoionized gas \citep{1990ApJ...362...90B}. We conclude
that the soft X-ray emission modeled using the Gaussians is likely a
combination of emission line blends and low-level thermal continuum.

The unabsorbed 2--10 keV {\it{reflected}} flux is
$4.24^{+0.57}_{-0.55} \times 10^{-13} ~\flux$ corresponding to a
rest-frame $L_{2-10} = 1.57^{+0.19}_{-0.19} \times 10^{44}
~\lum$. Adjusted for cosmology, this agrees with the measurement from
\citet{2001MNRAS.321L..15I}. Since we have used a pure reflection
model, the intrinsic QSO luminosity can only be estimated as
$(\kappa/\eta) L_{2-10}$ where $\kappa = 40$ is a bolometric
correction factor \citep{2007MNRAS.381.1235V} and $\eta = 0.06$ is the
reflector albedo \citep{2009MNRAS.397.1549M}. This gives $\lqso = 1.05
~(\pm 0.13) \times 10^{47} ~\lum$. In regards to the process of
radiative feedback, the model of \citet{2005ApJ...619...60L} predicts
a QSO driven gas outflow will have a kinetic power of $L_{\rm{kin}}
\approx 0.05 \lqso$, with a total energy $E_{\rm{kin}} < L_{\rm{kin}}
\tsonic$, where we assume the QSO lifetime is less than the age of the
cavities. Thus, for \irs, $L_{\rm{kin}} \sim 10^{45} ~\lum$ and
$E_{\rm{kin}} < 10^{60}$ erg, ten times the mechanical output of the
AGN. If this energy exceeds the thermal energy of the intergalactic
medium, then it is possible a highly supersonic ($M > 20$),
small-scale shock is being driven through the galaxy, coupling the
radiative output with the ambient gas.

Our measurement of the \feka\ equivalent width (\fekaew), which is a
valuable diagnostic for probing the environment of an AGN
\citep[see][for a review]{2000PASP..112.1145F}, agrees with previous
studies which found $\fekaew \la 1$ keV \citep{2000A&A...353..910F,
  2001MNRAS.321L..15I, 2007A&A...473...85P}. The large uncertainties
associated with these previous studies prevents us from determining if
\fekaew\ has varied since 1998. Our results are also consistent with
models and observations which show that $\fekaew \ga 0.5$ keV is
correlated with $\Gamma \ga 1.7$ and reflecting column densities
$\nhref \sim 10^{24} ~\pcmsq$ \citep{1996MNRAS.280..823M,
  1997ApJ...477..602N, 1999MNRAS.303L..11Z, 2005A&A...444..119G}.

Previous studies suggested the \bepposax\ PDS detection resulted
primarily from transmission of hard X-rays through an obscuring screen
with $\nhobs > 10^{24} ~\pcmsq$. Extrapolating our best-fit model out
to 10--80 keV reveals statistically acceptable agreement with the PDS
data (see Figure \ref{fig:resid}). The 10--200 keV model flux is
$f_{10 \dash 200} = 8.15^{+0.21}_{-0.19} \times 10^{-12} ~\flux$,
which is not significantly different from the $f_{10 \dash 200}$
measured with \bepposax. Addition of a second power-law component
($\Gamma = 1.7$) absorbed by a $\nhobs = 3 \times 10^{24} ~\pcmsq$
screen at the \irs\ redshift to the model lowered \chisq\ but with no
statistical improvement to the fit. If transmitted hard X-ray emission
falls within the passband used for spectral analysis, $\Gamma$ would
be artificially lowered, and the extrapolated hard X-ray flux thus
increases. However, for $\Gamma \ge 1.7$, column densities $> 3 \times
10^{24} ~\pcmsq$ are sufficient to suppress significant transmitted
emission below the 7 keV spectral analysis cut-off, indicating the
best-fit model should not have an artificially low $\Gamma$.

That we find no need for an additional hard X-ray component does not
contradict the well-founded conclusion that \irs\ harbors a
Compton-thick QSO. On the contrary, the measured \fekaew\ suggests
reflecting column densities of $\nhref \sim 1 \dash 5 \times 10^{24}
~\pcmsq$ \citep{1993MNRAS.263..314L, 2005A&A...444..119G,
  2010arXiv1005.3253C}. Assuming the density of material surrounding
the QSO is mostly homogeneous, \ie\ $\nhref \approx \nhobs$, our
results are consistent with the presence of a moderately Compton-thick
screen.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evolution of the feedback mode?}
\label{sec:evo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have shown that \irs\ has the typical characteristics of other
galaxies undergoing radiative and mechanical AGN feedback, and in this
section we consider their common origin and what affect they may be
having on the evolution of the galaxy.

The cold H$_2$ mass of \irs\ is $< 10^{10} ~\msol$
\citep{1998ApJ...506..205E}, there is $< 10^8 ~\msol$ of cold dust
\citep{2001MNRAS.326.1467D}, the hot dust mass is $\sim 10^9 ~\msol$
\citep{1997A&A...318L...1T}, and no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or
silicate absorption features are detected in the galaxy's IR spectrum
\citep{2004ApJ...613..986P, 2008ApJ...683..114S}. Given that the
\irs\ \halpha\ luminosity exceeds $10^{42} ~\lum$
\citep{1996MNRAS.283.1003C, 1998ApJ...506..205E}, compared with other
BCGs \citep[\eg][]{edge01}, \irs\ appears to be gas-poor with a low
gas-to-dust ratio. One possible explanation for the apparently low
molecular gas content is that it is being driven out by
non-relativistic winds \citep[\eg][]{2010MNRAS.401....7H}, and/or is
locked-up in stars. Indeed, integral field spectroscopy indicates the
presence of a $> 1000 ~\kmps$ emission line outflow coincident with
the nucleus \citep{1996MNRAS.283.1003C}. Further, the CO upper limits
found by \citet{1998ApJ...506..205E} do not exclude the existence of
low-mass, high-velocity molecular gas expelled by QSO winds. Given
that rapid and extensive dust formation is also expected in such QSO
winds \citep{2002ApJ...567L.107E}, this may further explain the
extreme dust richness of \irs. Gas consumption by star formation also
cannot be neglected: the \irs\ near-UV flux measured by \galex\ is
$\approx 47 ~\mu$Jy, which the relations of \citet{kennicutt2} predict
may be associated with $\approx 45 ~\msolpy$ of star formation.

\citet[][hereafter F09]{2009MNRAS.394L..89F} show that QSO radiation
pressure may have a significant influence on dusty material in the
host galaxy. F09 define the effective Eddington ratio to be $\leff =
\lqso (1.38 \times 10^{38} ~\mbh)^{-1} ~\erg^{-1} ~\s ~\msol$, and for
\irs, this has a value of $\approx 0.72$. In the \nhobs-\leff\ plane
presented by F09, which they divide into regions where obscuring
clouds are either long-lived or expelled, \irs\ resides near the
boundary of the two regions. It is then reasonable to suspect that gas
with a sight line to the QSO is being accelerated away from the QSO by
radiation pressure, and possibly being heated as well. These
conclusions are, however, at the mercy of our choice for \mbh, \ie\ if
$\mbh \ge 5 \times 10^9 ~\msol$, then $\leff < 0.2$, as where $\mbh <
1 \times 10^9 ~\msol$ implies $\leff > 1$.

All three of the primary channels which an AGN can exploit to
influence its environment (jets, winds, radiation) are plausibly
active in \irs, and it may be that these processes are simultaneously
conspiring to quench cooling within and around the host galaxy. The
mass accretion rate required to power the QSO is $\dmacc = \lqso/(0.1
c^2) \approx 20 ~\msolpy$, 300 times larger than the mass accretion
rate needed to power the jets. At this rate, the black hole mass would
double in $\approx 50$ Myr, and for the Magorrian relation to hold, $>
10^{11} ~\msol$ of stars would need to form, $> 10\%$ of the current
bulge mass. This seems unlikely, and thus the current period of QSO
activity is probably fleeting, and will soon give way to a sustained
period of sub-Eddington accretion that can still power mechanical
feedback via jets, the emergence of which may have signaled this
change. Further, H93 and H99 discuss in detail that the misalignment
between the large-scale radio jets and beamed nuclear radiation may be
correlated with evolution of the radio source from a \frii\ to \fri,
and that the jet axis realignment must have transpired in less than a
few Myrs. This bears discussion, as it may be related to the evolution
of the feedback cycle.

One simple explanation is that there are multiple SMBHs in the
nucleus, each with its own accretion system and beaming axis. We could
be seeing emission from two separate systems: one in quasar-mode,
another in radio-mode. Alternatively, a single SMBH may have undergone
a ``spin-flip'' \citep{2002Sci...297.1310M} when a smaller black hole
merged with it, thus reorienting the spin axis, which is believed to
be synonymous with the beaming axis. BCGs are known for cannibalism,
and 6 suspected companion galaxies reside within a projected 80 kpc of
the BCG \citep{1996AJ....111..649S, 1999Ap&SS.266..113A}, so it is not
out of the question that one or more mergers have taken place in the
last few Myrs. However, black hole mergers are lengthy (few Gyrs) and
difficult processes, and the spin axes of merging black holes may
naturally align when in a gas-rich environment
\citep{2007ApJ...661L.147B}. And if mergers are responsible for the
change of the spin axis direction, it is odd that the jets are very
linear and highly-structured. Merger induced ICM bulk motions and
turbulence are known to disrupt the flow of radio plasma such that the
observed synchrotron sources take on peculiar morphologies
\citep[\eg][]{2009A&A...495..721S, 2010arXiv1002.0395S}. It appears
then that if the misalignment arose via a merger, the orbit of infall
must have avoided the axis of the jets and been gentle (\ie\ subsonic)
so as not to stir the ICM.

Based on the spin evolution framework of \citet{gesspin}, there is yet
another intriguing explanation which does not specifically require
mergers to alter the SMBH spin axis. \citet{gesspin} suggest that
evolution of a black hole spin state from retrograde to prograde
relative to accreting matter is specifically correlated with a
transition of the radio source from a powerful \frii\ to a low-power
\fri. During the process of retrograde spin-down, the black hole must
pass through a state where the spin is $\approx 0$. At this point, if
there is an asymmetric accretion flow exceeding a \mbh-dependent
critical \dmacc, the spin axis can be dramatically reoriented on
timescales of a few Myrs (Cavagnolo et al., in preparation), possibly
giving rise to the type of jet-beamed radiation misalignment observed
in \irs. This process may also accompany quenching of the cold gas
reservoir in the host galaxy, hastening the transition from
quasar-dominated to radio-dominated feedback.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summ}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this paper we have shown, through a new \cxo\ X-ray observation,
that the AGN in \inine\ is interacting with the ICM of \rxj\ through
both the mechanical and radiative feedback channels. The results
presented in this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \rxj\ ICM global and radial properties reveal no signs of
  major cluster disturbance such as shocks or cold fronts. \rxj\ is an
  unremarkable, massive, cool-core galaxy cluster with a 12 \ent\ core
  entropy, a typical mass to temperature ratio, and a mean cluster gas
  fraction of 0.11.
\item We have discovered cavities in the X-ray halo of \irs\ which
  indicate an AGN outburst with total mechanical power of at least $3
  \times 10^{44} ~\lum$ and total energy output of $6 \times 10^{59}$
  erg. Comparison of the cavity sound speed ages and radio source ages
  indicate the outflow may be supersonic, and if significant gas
  shocking has occurred, the total kinetic power of the AGN may be
  $\sim 10^{45} ~\lum$.
\item Core ICM properties and the mass accretion rate required to
  power the AGN outburst suggest that fuel for the AGN was likely not
  accreted directly from the hot ICM, \ie\ via the Bondi mechanism,
  but rather attained through cold-mode accretion. This conclusion is
  consistent with the sub-kpc structure of the BCG halo and the X-ray
  properties of the nucleus.
\item Detection of an X-ray excess 13--26 kpc NE of the nucleus
  indicates beamed radiation from the $\sim 10^{47} ~\lum$ QSO is
  escaping the nucleus and interacting with the ICM in the same region
  as a strongly photoionized nebulae. The X-ray emission properties of
  this region are well-fit by a model where the nebula and ICM are
  being irradiated by the QSO.
\item The nuclear X-ray source is well-fit by a reflection-dominated
  model where the power law source is obscured by moderately
  Compton-thick material. The width of the nuclear \feka\ fluorescence
  emission line indicates a reflecting column density, and presumably
  obscuring column density, of $> 10^{24} ~\pcmsq$. We also show that
  the \bepposax\ PDS detection of hard X-ray emission can be explained
  by reflected emission.
\item Based on the obvious QSO nuclear activity, interaction of the
  X-ray halo and jets, ostensible \irs\ gas-poorness, nuclear emission
  line outflow, high effective Eddington QSO luminosity, and
  misalignment of the large-scale radio jets and beamed radiation from
  the nucleus, we suggest that \irs\ is evolving from a
  radiation-dominated mode of feedback to a kinetic-dominated
  mode. Among other possible explanations, we speculate that the
  observed properties of \irs\ may be related to the process of SMBH
  spin evolution, and further suggest that \irs\ is a local example of
  how massive galaxies at higher redshifts evolve from quasar-mode
  into radio-mode.
\end{itemize}

%% The Magorrian relation suggests that for every unit of mass

%% Myr, requiring more than $10^{11} ~\msol$ of stars to form in the
