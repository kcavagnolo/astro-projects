We propose to do high throughput spatialy resolved spectroscopy, with
XMM, on a sample of 4 cool clusters (T = 2-3 keV) in the redshift
range z=0.04-0.06.  XMM/EPIC is the best instrument to measure the
temperature and abundance profiles in these objects, up to large radii
from the center.  We will thus be able to estimate accuratly the gas
entropy distribution, the relative distribution of the gas and the
dark matter, the abundance of Iron and lpha elements and their
gradients.  These are the key constrains on the chemical and
thermodynamical history of the gas.  This will allow a major step
forward in our understanding of the role of galaxy feedback in cluster
evolution.
