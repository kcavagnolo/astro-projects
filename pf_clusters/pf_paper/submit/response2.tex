Dear Editor,

Below is our reply to the Referee's Report for ApJS Article
295532. The referee's comments were again very helpful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Revisions to Section 5.6.1:

We have rewritten Section 5.6.1 to focus the discussion on a strict
comparison between our work and that of previsouly published
XMM-Newton work. We highlight that it is the larger radial bins of the
XMM entropy profiles which conceals the core flattening, and that when
we degrade our profiles to have a similar radial bin size, the core
flattening is indeed washed out. There are additional details
discussed in the text of this section which we think meet all of the
referee's concerns and suggestions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

We have also added an acknowledgment of the referee as the reports
thus far have significantly improved the manuscript.
